Panama says drug-running Colombian rebels have planted landmines in Panama near
the two countries' shared border.

Panamanian Security Minister Jose Mulino said Friday that whoever planted the
mines is apparently "protecting something" in the area.

Mulino did not say how many mines were found in the Darien region where two
police officers were wounded last week in a mine blast.

The region has been the scene of occasional incursions by rebels into
Panamanian territory in the past. Â
