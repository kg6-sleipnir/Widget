Security sources in Yemen say tribesmen have blown up an oil pipeline in
retaliation for raids targeting al-Qaida sympathizers.

Officials say tribesman in eastern Maarib province sabotaged the pipeline
Saturday, after government forces raided the homes of tribal leaders thought to
be harboring al-Qaida operatives.

On Wednesday, more than 20 people were wounded when security forces clashed
with tribesmen in eastern Yemen during the operation to apprehend Hassan al-
Aqili.

Aqili is wanted for the death of a senior army officer, killed in an ambush
last Saturday.
