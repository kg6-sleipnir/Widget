Colombian authorities say leftist rebels have attacked a military convoy in
southern Colombia with explosives, killing 10 servicemen.
A military commander says the attack was carried out by the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) in Putumayo state, one of Colombia's biggest cocaine-
producing regions.
The FARC, along with a smaller rebel group and rightist paramilitaries, is
locked in a long-running war with the government that leaves thousands of
people dead each year.
