Traditional fishermen in poor countries around the world face tough competition
from international industrial fishing operations.  In the fishing-rich West
African nation of Guinea, there are laws meant to preserve some waters for the
local fishermen. But a lack of money means these laws often are not enforced. 
Kari Barber reports from Conakry that many traditional fishermen feel they are
being squeezed out of their livelihoods.
