Bangladeshi authorities have slaughtered nearly 20,000 chickens after bird flu
was detected at a government-run poultry farm.
Officials Tuesday said the latest infection of the potentially deadly H5N1
virus occurred at the farm in Mirpur, just outside Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka.
The bird flu was first detected in Bangladesh in March of 2007 at a state-owned
poultry farm. Since then, the government has slaughtered more than 300,000
chickens.
No human cases of infection have been reported so far.
Officials say Bangladesh has about 150,000 poultry farms, with an annual
turnover of $750 million.
