Isolated grass fires continue to burn in the southern U.S. states of Oklahoma
and Texas, but they have weakened since killing one elderly woman and scorching
dozens of homes on Tuesday.
Officials said decreased winds and slightly cooler temperatures have helped
firefighters contain the blazes. But there are worries that continuing drought
conditions could lead to new fires.
The initial fires are being blamed on children playing with fireworks or people
being careless with discarded cigarettes.
On Tuesday, Texas governor Rick Perry dispatched National Guard troops to help
battle the blazes and declared the fires a disaster.
