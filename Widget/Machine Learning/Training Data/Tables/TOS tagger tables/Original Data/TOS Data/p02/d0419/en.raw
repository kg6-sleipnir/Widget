The U.S. military says a soldier is being held in Iraq for allegedly killing
two other American servicemen during an argument.

A military statement released Tuesday says Specialist Neftaly Platero was
detained after the killing of two soldiers in Fallujah, Iraq, last Thursday.

Colonel Barry Johnson says a "verbal altercation" broke out among four
soldiers.  The military spokesman says Platero allegedly took out his weapon
and began shooting at the other soldiers.  A third soldier was wounded in the
incident.
