Venezuelan media say President Hugo Chavez heads to ally Cuba Monday.
 
Reports say Mr. Chavez had planned to start the official trip Sunday.  The
reason for the delay was not clear.
Mr. Chavez visited Cuban leader Fidel Castro last month, in what a newspaper
called a "gesture of solidarity."  The Venezuelan leader also wanted to check
on Mr. Castro's health, following his accidental fall in October. 
Venezuela's opposition accuses Mr. Chavez of trying to impose Cuban-style
communism at home.
