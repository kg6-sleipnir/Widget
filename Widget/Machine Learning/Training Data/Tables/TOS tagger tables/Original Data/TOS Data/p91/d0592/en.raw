The U.S. military in Afghanistan says coalition forces killed four Afghan
policemen and wounded a fifth after mistaking them for militants.
The military says the incident occurred during a firefight Thursday, near
Gereshk in Helmand province, when U.S. troops battling militants opened fire on
an approaching vehicle carrying five armed men - all Afghan police officers out
of uniform.
Afghan officials confirmed the Americans' account of the shooting. The U.S.
military said the regrettable incident is being investigated.
