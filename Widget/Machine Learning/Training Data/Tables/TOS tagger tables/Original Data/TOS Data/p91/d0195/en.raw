Indian police say they have killed three suspected Islamic militants in a
shootout in the Indian portion of Kashmir.
Local authorities say the incident occurred Thursday in Doda district north of
the winter capital, Jammu, and that the three belonged to the Pakistan-based
Lashkar-e-Toiba militant group.
Lashkar-e-Toiba is one of about a dozen Muslim separatist groups that have been
fighting since 1989 for an independent Kashmir or its merger with Pakistan.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the conflict.
