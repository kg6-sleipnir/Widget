A truck carrying Hindu pilgrims has plunged into a gorge in northern India,
killing at least 15 people.

Officials say the truck ran off the road in Uttarakhand state Sunday and fell
into the deep gorge.Â  They say the passengers were on their way to the town of
Gangotri for a Hindu ritual.

India has frequent road accidents due to reckless driving, poor vehicle
maintenance and overcrowding.
