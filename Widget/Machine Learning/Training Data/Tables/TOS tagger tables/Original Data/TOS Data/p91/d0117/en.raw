Parisians have joined hands and formed a "human chain" around central Paris to
mark the sixth anniversary of the abduction of the French-Colombian politician
Ingrid Betancourt.
The Colombian rebel group FARC kidnapped Betancourt on February 23rd, 2002 as
she campaigned for the Colombian presidency. French president Nicolas Sarkozy
has taken an interest in Betancourt's case and made securing her release a
priority.
Betancourt's daughter made up part of
Saturday'shuman chain, along with the recently liberated hostage Consuelo
Gonzales.
