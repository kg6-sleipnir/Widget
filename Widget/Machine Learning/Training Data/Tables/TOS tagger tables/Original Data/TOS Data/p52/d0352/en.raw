A public opinion poll released in Paksitan on June 20th shows that 58 percent
of Pakistanis support talks with the tribal militants, and that anti-U.S.
sentiments remain negative.
The pollsters found more than half of the respondents blame the U.S. for the
violence occurring in Pakistan while few hold al-Qaida responsible, but that
the U.S. has an opportunity to turn public opinion in its favor.
The survey was conducted in Pakistan by two Washington-based not profit
organizations:  Terror Free Tomorrow and a think tank, the New America
Foundation. VOA's Ravi Khanna has more.
