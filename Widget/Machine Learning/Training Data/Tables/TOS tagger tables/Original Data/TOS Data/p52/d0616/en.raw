The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission [CPSC] has launched a new program
to screen toys and other imports for potential safety hazards.  Working with
U.S. Customs agents, the new import surveillance program plans to test selected
products at various ports in the United States to make sure the products are
safe before they enter the U.S. market.
