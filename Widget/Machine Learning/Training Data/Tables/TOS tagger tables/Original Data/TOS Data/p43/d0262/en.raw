Alberto GonzalesÂ 
President Bush's attorney general, the head of the U.S. Justice Department, has
arrived in Baghdad on a surprise visit to show support for the Iraqi
government.
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has been surrounded by heavy security in the
Iraqi capital as he visits with American soldiers and Iraqi officials.
Reporters who traveled with Mr. Gonzales to Baghdad say he intended this trip,
on the eve of the U.S. Independence Day holiday, to show support for the Iraqi
government's commitment to democracy despite continuing deadly attacks by
insurgents.
