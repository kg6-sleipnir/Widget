Israeli troops have shot and killed a young Palestinian girl in the southern
Gaza Strip, after militants fired mortar rounds at a nearby Jewish settlement.
Officials say the confrontation began when militants fired three mortars at the
settlement near the Khan Younis refugee camp. Four Israelis, including one
child, were hurt.
In response, the Israeli military fired into the refugee camp, killing the
young girl.
Palestinian militants often fire homemade mortars and missiles into Jewish
settlements in Gaza, but they rarely cause any injury or damage.
