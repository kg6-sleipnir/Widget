Afghan officials say suspected Taleban gunmen have killed six policemen during
a raid on a police post in southern Helmand province.
Authorities said Wednesday thatÂ one gunman was killed in a shoot-out with the
militants late Tuesday in the Kajaki district.
Taleban militants have carried out a guerrilla insurgency in Afghanistan since
U.S.-led forces ousted the Islamic extremist government three years ago.
