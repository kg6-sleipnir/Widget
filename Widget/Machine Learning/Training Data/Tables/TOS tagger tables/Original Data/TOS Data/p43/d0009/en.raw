Russian officials say President Vladimir Putin will travel to Libya Wednesday
at the invitation of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
The talks between the two leaders meeting in the North African country are
expected to focus on gas exploration deals with Russia's natural gas company,
Gazprom.
The two-day visit will be one of Mr. Putin's last foreign trips before he steps
down from office next month, when Dmitry Medvedev will replace him.
Mr. Putin is expected to become Russia's prime minister.
