Pakistani officials say government troops have killed at least 43 militants in
an ongoing operation in the northwestern Khyber tribal region bordering
Afghanistan.

Authorities say one of the bases of the militant group Lashkar-e-Islam was
destroyed in Saturday's attack. Â 

Pakistan is under intense U.S. pressure to crack down on militants close to the
Afghan border.

Khyber is on the main land route through Pakistan into Afghanistan.
