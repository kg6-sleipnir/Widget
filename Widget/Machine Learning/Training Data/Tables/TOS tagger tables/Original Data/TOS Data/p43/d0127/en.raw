Pakistani police say they have arrested five people in Karachi for allegedly
plotting attacks on security forces and government buildings in the nation's
commercial capital.

Karachi's police chief, Waseem Ahmed, told reporters Wednesday the suspected
terrorists belong to the Sunni extremist group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.  

Police say they recovered weapons and ammunition when they captured the men
during a raid Tuesday night in the Sohrab Goth neighborhood, in the southern
city.   

The police chief says the men planned to target several government buildings
and the police head office in Karachi.
