A senior Afghan intelligence official says a military aircraft crashed in the
country's northern region Thursday.

Provincial intelligence chief Abdul Majid Azimi says the aircraft went down in
the mountains of Afghanistan's Baghlan province.  He says it is unclear if the
aircraft involved is a helicopter or a plane or to whom it belonged.

A spokesman for NATO's international coalition in Afghanistan (International
Security Assistance Force or ISAF) says there were no immediate reports of a
crash involving any of its aircraft.
