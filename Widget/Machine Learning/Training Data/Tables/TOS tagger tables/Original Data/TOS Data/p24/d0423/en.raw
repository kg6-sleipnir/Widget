A human rights group says tens of thousands of women and girls in the eastern
part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been raped by armed groups on
both sides of the conflict.
U.S.-based Human Rights Watch says government soldiers and rebel forces have
sexually assaulted females on a daily basis since fighting broke out in 1998. 
But the group says only a handful have been prosecuted for the crimes.
Human Rights Watch says many more incidents of rape have probably gone
unreported in the Congo.
