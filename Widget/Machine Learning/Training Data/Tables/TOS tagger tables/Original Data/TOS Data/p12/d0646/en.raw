French President Jacques Chirac has pledged his country's continued military
support for the Afghan government.
The announcement came Monday during his meeting in Paris with Afghan President
Hamid Karzai, who arrived on Sunday for a three-day visit.
France currently has about 600 soldiers in the NATO-led international peace-
keeping force in Afghanistan.
The Afghan president says he eventually wants to see the NATO peace-keeping
forces and the U.S.-led combat troops merged under the unified command of NATO.
