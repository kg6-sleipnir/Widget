Iraqi officials say a suicide bomber has killed three people and wounded at
least 10 others in central Baghdad.

Officials say the bomber targeted a police unit Wednesday in the Karradah
neighborhood.

Also Wednesday, two Iraqi policemen were killed by a suicide bomber in the
northern city, Mosul.

Violence in Iraq has dropped sharply over the past year, but the security
situation remains fragile. 

The U.S. military has been transferring security responsibilities to the Iraqi
government, with U.S. forces scheduled to withdraw from the country by 2011.
