America has more than 1,000 art museums, 35 aviation museums, and even a museum
dedicated to rock 'n roll music. Now a new kind of museum is opening its doors
in downtown Manhattan. Its location near the former World Trade Center site is
part of an effort to revitalize the neighborhood left economically depressed
after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the U.S. VOA's Nathan King
reports.
