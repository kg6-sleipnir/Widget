Before and during the Olympics, the issue of Tibet was frequently in the news. 
In March, an anti-government demonstration in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa,
turned into a riot. It catapulted the Himalayan region into the headlines and
led to protests that disrupted the Olympic torch relay. In the closing days of
the Beijing Olympics, China showcased a new production of an old propaganda
opera that presents an image of Sino-Tibetan harmony.  Stephanie Ho reports
