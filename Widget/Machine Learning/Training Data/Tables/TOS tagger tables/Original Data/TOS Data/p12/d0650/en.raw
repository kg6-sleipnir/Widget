The UN Security Council unanimously adopted two resolutions 
Thursday — one on the DRC and the other on Somalia. 
The Security Council has voted in favor of sending an additional 
3,000 troops to DRC to beef up MONUC, the UN mission there. 
It also approved giving the sanctions committee authority to impose 
sanctions against those who impede the peace process in Somalia, 
hinder humanitarian aid efforts and violate the arms embargo.
