Iraqi officials say two car bombs in the Shi'ite holy city of Karbala have
killed at least five people and wounded about 55.

Police say the first bomb exploded Monday near the Imam Hussein shrine, a holy
site for Shi'ite Muslims.

Officials say a second blast went off minutes later in the vicinity, near a
provincial office.
