Leatherback turtles fascinate ocean researchers. The largest of sea turtles
roams the world's oceans, nesting and feeding in coastal regions. Scientists
say leatherbacks have been doing so for at least 65 million years. But little
else is known to researchers about this species, other than their numbers are
dwindling.
Recently, U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists
strapped a transmitter on one and were amazed by what they found. Paul Sisco
has more.
