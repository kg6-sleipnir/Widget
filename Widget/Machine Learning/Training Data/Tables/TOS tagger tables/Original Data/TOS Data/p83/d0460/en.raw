Hundreds of pro-Kremlin youth demonstrated outside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow
Monday, following the convincing victory of Dmitri Medvedev in Sunday's
presidential election.
Members of the youth group Nashi wore capes emblazoned with the slogan "Russia
Forward."
A large banner said American wives should be taught to cook cabbage soup.
The phrase is a reference to a sarcastic comment President Vladimir Putin made
last month that Western election observers should mind their own business and
teach their wives to make cabbage soup.
