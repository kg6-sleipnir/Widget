Riots have broken out in the capital of Algeria because of soaring food prices.

Protesters set fires and hurled stones at police in Algiers late Wednesday and
Thursday. Security officers responded with tear gas.

Tensions remained high in the capital's neighborhood of Bab el-Oued on
Thursday, where security officers patrolled the streets.

The violence erupted after price hikes were enacted for basic items, such as
sugar, flour and oil.
