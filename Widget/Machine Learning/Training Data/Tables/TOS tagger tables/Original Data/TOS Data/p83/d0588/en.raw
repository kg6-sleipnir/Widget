According to the American Heart Association, cardiac arrest occurs more than
900 times a day in the United States. Almost half of these incidents are
unexpected and occur in places other than a hospital. In many cases, death can
be prevented if medical help arrives quickly. 
VOA's Melinda Smith says a new study reveals that location where the victim is
located can greatly influence survival.
