Police in Indian Kashmir say suspected militants have set fire to a government
building, trapping dozens of workers. At least one person has died.
Reports from Kashmir's summer capital, Srinagar, say at least two militants
marched into an income tax office Friday and started the blaze.
A security official told Associated Press that authorities are trying to storm
the building in order to put out the blaze and evacuate civilians safely.
Militants opposed to Indian rule in Kashmir have waged a guerilla campaign
against Indian authorities since 1989.
