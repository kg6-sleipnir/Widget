Ethiopian officials say swarms of desert locusts have invaded northern
Ethiopia, threatening crops and agriculture.
The officials say they are most concerned the locusts may lay eggs, leading to
a massive invasion in the future.
The government says it has begun aerial surveillance of the swarms.
The flying insects can eat their weight in crops daily, devastating thousands
of hectares of farmland used by both humans and livestock.
Last week, the United Nations Food and Agriculture agency warned that desert
locusts were threatening Sudan and Eritrea.
