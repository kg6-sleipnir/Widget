Three Palestinians and an Israeli have been killed in continuing Middle East
violence.
Israeli officials say Palestinian gunmen Wednesday shot dead an Israeli
civilian west of the city of Hebron. Officials say the Israeli man was working
on the barrier that the Jewish state is building inside the West Bank.
Also Wednesday, Israeli troops shot and killed three Palestinians in different
parts of the Gaza Strip.
The death of Yasser Arafat last month brought new hopes for peace in the
region. However, while the violence has decreased, it has not stopped.
