Mexican authorities have found 18 bodies buried near a ranch in the northern
state of Chihuahua, which borders the United States.

Investigators Monday said soldiers uncovered the remains recently, but that it
was not clear who was buried in the graves.  

Word of the discovery came as a woman police chief, Hermila Garcia was ambushed
and shot dead on a highway near the town of Meoqui, which is in Chihuahua. 
Garcia had served as Meoqui's police chief since October.
