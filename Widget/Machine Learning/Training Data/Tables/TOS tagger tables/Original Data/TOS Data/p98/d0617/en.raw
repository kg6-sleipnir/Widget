Three policemen have been shot dead near the Pakistani capital Islamabad.

A police spokesman said the bodies of the dead men were discovered early
Sunday.

He said the men were apparently shot in their sleep, each by a single bullet to
the head.

The men were guarding a railway bridge in Hasan Abdal, a town 40 kilometers
west of Islamabad.

The police spokesman refused to comment on whether the slayings were a criminal
act or an attack linked to the Taliban, who frequently target police and
security forces.
