Tribesmen in northwestern Pakistan say they publicly executed four people
Monday, on charges of adultery.
The three men and one woman were taken from a home in the Khyber region and
shot dead in a public square after confessing their crime to a tribal council,
or jirga.
Tribal leaders confirmed the four were punished according to their customs and
tradition.
Human rights organizations have criticized such public executions. The
punishments often occur in Pakistan's remote, semi-autonomous tribal areas,
where the federal government has limited jurisdiction.
