Sudanese authorities have released Islamist leader Hassan Turabi, more than a
year after he was detained over allegations he was plotting a coup.
Officials with Mr. Turabi's opposition Popular Congress party confirmed the
release.
Mr. Turabi had been arrested last year along with other members of his party
and accused of plotting a coup against President Omar Hassan al-Bashir.
Mr. Turabi, a former ally of Mr. Bashir, was never brought to trial.
