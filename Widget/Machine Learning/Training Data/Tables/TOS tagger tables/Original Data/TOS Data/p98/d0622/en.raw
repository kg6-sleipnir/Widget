U.S. stocks were down as much as one percent as Thursday's trading got
underway.

European shares made modest gains in afternoon trading.

Many Asian markets declined despite Wednesday's Senate vote.  Tokyo's Nikkei
index lost nearly two percent, while the indexes in Sydney, South Korea and
Taiwan also dropped. 

But Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained just over one percent by the close.
