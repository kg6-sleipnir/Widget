The Arab League says an emergency Arab summit scheduled for Wednesday at the
Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh has been postponed, following the death of
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd.
An Arab League official, Hisham Youssef, at the Red Sea resort told reporters
that the postponement "is for a few days," and that consultations will soon
begin to decide on a new date for the summit.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last week called the summit to discuss the
situation in Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and terrorism.
