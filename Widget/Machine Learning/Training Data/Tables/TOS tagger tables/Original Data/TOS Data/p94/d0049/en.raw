Bolivian President Evo Morales has declared a national disaster in the Andean
country following heavy rains and flooding that have killed at least 50 people
in recent weeks.
Mr. Morales issued the decree Tuesday to release government aid to flooded
areas. On Monday, he toured the hard-hit city of Trinidad, where officials have
pitched tents to accommodate people fleeing the town's flooded outskirts.
Officials say the flooding has affected some 45,000 families across Bolivia.
