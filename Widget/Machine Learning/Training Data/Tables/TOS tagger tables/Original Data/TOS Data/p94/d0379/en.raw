Clashes in southern Afghanistan have killed at least 30 Taliban fighters,
including one Taliban commander.
The Afghan Defense Ministry says the operation took place Wednesday in southern
Helmand province, a region where Taliban militants are highly active.
Afghan officials say a coalition of Afghan and foreign special forces mounted
coordinated attacks on insurgent cells in the Musa Qala region.
Authorities say coalition aircraft bombed militant cells during a five-hour
battle. No coalition casualties were reported.
Separately, a roadside bomb in Helmand hit a British patrol, killing one
soldier and wounding four others.
