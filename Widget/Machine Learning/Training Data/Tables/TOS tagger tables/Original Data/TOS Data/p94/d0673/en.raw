Turkish officials say a man fired shots at security guards after being
prevented from entering the offices of the head of Turkey's Higher Education
Board.
They say the unidentified assailant tried to enter by force the office of
Erdogan Tezic. The man fled the scene, and there were no reports of injuries.
Tezic, a strict secularist, has been highly critical of Turkey's ruling AK
Party. The Islamist-rooted party announced Foreign Minister Adbullah Gul as
their presidential candidate Tuesday.
