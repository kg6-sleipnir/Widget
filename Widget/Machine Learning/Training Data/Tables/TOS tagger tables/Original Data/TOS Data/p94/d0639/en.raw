Reports from Japan say at least 100 people have died in snow-related accidents
this season.
The toll includes a six-year-old boy who died Monday when snow from the roof of
a day-care center fell on him as he played with friends in the facility's
playground.
The death toll is the highest since the winter of 1983-1984 when 131 people
died in northern Japan.
Officials are warning that avalanches pose a danger as temperatures warm
briefly this week.Â  Some areas are piled with nearly four meters of snow.
