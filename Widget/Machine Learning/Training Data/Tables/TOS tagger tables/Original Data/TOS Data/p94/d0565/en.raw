An Israeli official says Israel is considering plans to build a nuclear power
station in its southern Negev desert.
Israel Army Radio quoted Infrastructure Minister Binyamin Ben-Elizer as saying
he has the support of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and that the plan would be
considered in coming months.
The construction of a nuclear power plant could draw renewed attention to what
is widely believed to be Israel's nuclear weapons program.Â  Following a policy
that it calls "nuclear ambiguity," Israel has never admitted nor denied having
a nuclear weapons program.
