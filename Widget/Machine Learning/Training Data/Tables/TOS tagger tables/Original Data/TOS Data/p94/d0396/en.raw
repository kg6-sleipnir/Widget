Indian officials say a seven-story bulding has collapsed in the financial
capital, Mumbai, killing at least 22 people and injured nine others.
Authorities say at least 10 people may still be trapped in the rubble, more
than 12 hours after the collapse late Wednesday.
Rescue workers are sifting the debris and using cranes to remove concrete.
The cause of the collapse is not yet known.
