Taleban militants have attacked a convoy in southern Afghanistan, killing up to
13 Afghan guards and wounding others who worked for a private security firm.
Officials said Monday that the convoy was attacked late Sunday on the road from
the capital, Kabul, to Kandahar. That is the same road where a group of 23
South Korean Christian evangelicals was abducted on July 19 and where two
Germans were kidnapped in a separate incident.
Sunday's attack led to a long gun battle with insurgents that resulted in the
death of five Taleban militants.
