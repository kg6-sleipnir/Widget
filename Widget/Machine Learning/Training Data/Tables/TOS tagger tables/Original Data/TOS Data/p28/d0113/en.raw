Chinese state media say an explosion at a chemical plant in eastern China has
killed at least 14 people and injured 30 others.
The official Xinhua news agency says the blast happened Friday at a chemical
plant in Anhui province's Dangtu County.  It is not immediately clear how many
workers were in the plant at the time of the explosion.
Xinhua says the plant produces explosives for civilian uses such as mining.
