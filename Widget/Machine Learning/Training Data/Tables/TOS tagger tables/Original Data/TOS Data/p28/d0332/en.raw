The word tattoo is most often associated with artwork on someone's body. But it
also a military tradition dating back to the 17th century of calling soldiers
or sailors back to their quarters at night with a drum or bugle. Each year that
tradition is recreated in Washington in a weekly sunset military pageant known
as the "Twilight Tattoo". VOA's Jeff Feuer has more on this storied tradition.
