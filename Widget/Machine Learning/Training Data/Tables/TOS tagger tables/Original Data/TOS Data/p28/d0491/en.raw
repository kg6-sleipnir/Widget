Palestinian officials say militants have agreed to halt mortar and rocket
attacks on Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip that have threatened to derail
a three-month cease-fire with Israel.
A Palestinian Interior Ministry spokesman Saturday, said the groups, including
Hamas, agreed to stop the attacks after meeting late Thursday with Interior
Minister Nasser Youssef.
Hamas unleashed intensive mortar strikes on Jewish settlements earlier in the
week after Israeli soldiers killed several militants.
Israel has threatened to use all necessary means to halt the attacks.
