Sweden will have the chance to add the Olympic Games women's curling title to
its world and European crowns. The Swedes reached the tournament final at the
Turin Winter Games with a 5-4 semifinal victory over Norway Wednesday.
In the final on Thursday, Sweden will face Switzerland, which was a 7-5 winner
over 1998 Olympic champion Canada.
Both Sweden and Switzerland will compete for gold with identical records in
Turin. Each finished the preliminary round with win-loss records of 7-2 in the
10-nation tournament.
