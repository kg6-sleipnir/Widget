Oil prices fell sharply Monday as the U.S. House of Representatives voted
against a $700-billion government plan to rescue troubled U.S. financial
institutions.

The price of a barrel of oil for future delivery dropped more than $10 to hit
$96.26 a barrel at the close of New York trading Monday.

Traders worried that rejection of the controversial plan could hurt U.S.
economic growth, and cut demand for energy.
