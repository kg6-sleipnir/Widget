Election officials in Haiti have scheduled runoff elections for a new
legislative assembly for late April.
The election was originally scheduled for March 19, but was delayed following
widespread street protests that accompanied last month's presidential
elections.
Rene Preval was declared president after his supporters staged angry
demonstrations accusing election officials of manipulating the vote count to
deny him a first-round victory.
The delay in holding the legislative runoffs forced the postponement of
Preval's inauguration, which was scheduled for March 29.
