Pope Benedict says the anniversary of the 2001 September 11 attacks on the
United States should be a day to remember all victims of terrorism.
The pope Sunday called for all people to, in his words, "renounce hatred and
build a world of justice, solidarity, and peace."
The Roman Catholic leader made his comments to pilgrims gathered outside his
summer residence in Castelgandolfo near Rome to hear his weekly blessing.
