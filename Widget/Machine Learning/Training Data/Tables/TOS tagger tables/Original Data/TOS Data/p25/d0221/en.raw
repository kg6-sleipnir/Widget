The Palestinian parliament has passed a new electoral law, removing an obstacle
that had delayed elections for a new legislature.
The new law creates a mixed electoral system, with half the lawmakers to be
chosen by districts and the other half to be chosen from a national slate of
party candidates.
Differences over the voting system led to the postponement earlier this month
of elections that had been scheduled for mid-July. There is no word yet on a
date for re-scheduled elections.
