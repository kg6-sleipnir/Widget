Former women's world number-one tennis player Martina Hingis of Switzerland
will play in her first professional tournament in more than two years in
Thailand next month.
Hingis has agreed to play the Volvo Women's Open in Pattaya. She says she will
use the tournament to raise money for Thai charities that help women and
children who have suffered from abuse, homelessness and illness.
Hingis won 76 singles and doubles titles during her career, including five
Grand Slam singles crowns. She retired at age 22 in 2002 due to ankle problems.
