Iran's nuclear energy chief says the country has built a new generation of
centrifuges, which are used to enrich uranium.

Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization, announced the
development Tuesday.

Enriched uranium can be used in nuclear fuel for a power plant. But Western
countries suspect Iran is using the ingredient to build a nuclear weapon.

Iran denies this.

Iranian officials are expected to resume negotiations with world powers about
their controversial nuclear program next week.
