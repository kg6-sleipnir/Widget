British military officials in Iraq say three British soldiers have been killed
in a suspected roadside bombing in the southern part of the country.
The British command says the attack occurred early Saturday in the city of
Amarah, north of Basra.
The combat deaths were the first for British forces in Iraq in months.
British forces, based in the mainly Shi'ite south, have suffered far fewer
losses than the much larger U.S. force fighting Sunni Arab insurgents and
foreign fighters in the rest of Iraq.
