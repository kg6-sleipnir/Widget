Witnesses say Syrian security forces have clashed with gunmen thought to be
Islamist militants in the northwestern city of Aleppo.
The Associated Press quotes residents as saying the clashes occurred Sunday on
a road leading to the airport in the city.
Al Jazeera television said as many as three gunmen died when they blew up their
car after being surrounded by police. There were no reports of further
casualties.
There has been no official confirmation of the clash from the Damascus
government.
