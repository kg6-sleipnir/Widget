The head of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has called
on the United States to release some of its oil reserves to help reduce world
oil prices.
Purnomo Yusgiantoro, who is also Indonesia's energy minister, did not say
whether the United States has responded to the request.
The United States has hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in its strategic
petroleum reserve. The reserve has been tapped on several, exceptional
occasions.
World oil prices have risen sharply this year, and currently stand at over $55
a barrel.
