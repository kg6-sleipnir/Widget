An avalanche in a mountainous area of northern Pakistan has killed 25 people
who were digging for precious stones.
Officials say the incident happened Thursday in the remote Kohistan region, in
Pakistan's Northwest Frontier province.
Authorities say the victims were exploring mines and searching for precious
stones when they were buried by the avalanche. Rescuers rushed to the site but
were only able to save one person.
Kohistan is about 350 kilometers northeast of Peshawar, the provincial capital.
