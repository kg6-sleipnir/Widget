The Vatican has announced that U.S. President George Bush will meet with Pope
Benedict in June.
Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said Saturday that the exact date for the
private meeting has not yet been set, but it could be around June 9 or June 10.
President Bush is to travel to Europe in June to attend a summit of the Group
of Eight industrialized nations in Germany.
Mr. Bush visited the Vatican in 2005 for Pope John Paul's funeral.
