Crude oil prices rose Wednesday after a government report showed U.S. supplies
of crude oil, gasoline, and other oil products declined last week.
The Energy Department report said crude oil inventories dropped more than one
million barrels, a decline of about one-third of a percent.
Stocks of gasoline declined around 1.5 percent, which is more than experts had
predicted.
The price of a barrel of crude oil for future delivery rose 69 cents to $77 a
barrel in New York.Â  London prices also rose.
