Lebanese security officials say a car bomb explosion has killed a senior member
of the militant Palestinian group Islamic Jihad in Sidon, Friday.
The officials say the militant's brother also died in the blast near the
central square of the southern coastal city.
There has been no claim of responsibility for the bombing.
Islamic Jihad blamed Israel for the attack on the militant leader Mahmoud
Majzoub, but Israeli officials denied any knowledge of the bombing.
