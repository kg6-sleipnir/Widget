Police said a bomb blast in eastern Sri Lanka has killed one police officer and
one civilian.
 
Authorities said Tamil Tiger rebels were responsible for the blast in the town
of Batticaloa.  They said the blast wounded 11 people, including four
schoolchildren.  

A Tamil Tiger spokesman could not be reached for comment.

The bombing came as the military surrounded the rebels in the country's
northeast in a push to end the 25-year-old civil war.  

Journalists are often unable to independently confirm military and rebel
reports because they are barred from the war zone.
