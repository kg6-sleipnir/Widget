Forecasters say Hurricane Otis is gaining strength as it moves closer to
Mexico's northwestern coast.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center says the Category One storm has winds of 150
kilometers per hour and is moving toward the Baja California Peninsula.
The storm is currently projected to hit the central portion of the Baja
Peninsula as early as Sunday. Forecasters warn that a shift in position could
result in an earlier landfall on the southern end of the peninsula.
