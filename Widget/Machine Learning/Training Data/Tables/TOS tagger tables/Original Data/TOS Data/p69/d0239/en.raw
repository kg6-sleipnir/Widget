Iraqi police say a car bomb in northern Baghdad has killed 12 people.

At least 22 others were wounded in Sunday's attack, which took place near a
passport office in the capital's northern Adhamiya district.

In other violence in Iraq's capital, nine people, including six civilians, were
wounded when a roadside bomb exploded near a police patrol.

The bombings came hours before Iraq's parliament is scheduled to hold a special
session to try to resolve a dispute about power-sharing proposals for the
northern region of Kirkuk.
