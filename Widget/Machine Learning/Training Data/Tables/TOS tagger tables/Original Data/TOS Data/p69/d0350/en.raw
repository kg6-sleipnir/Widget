Doctors say Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon remains in critical but stable
condition - 10 days after suffering a massive stroke.
Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital issued the update on Mr. Sharon's condition
Saturday evening after the end of the Jewish sabbath.
The hospital said medical tests showed that Mr. Sharon has activity in both of
his brain lobes.
For several days, doctors have been reducing the level of sedatives, with the
intent of drawing the 77-year-old Mr. Sharon out of an induced coma. However,
he has not shown any signs of waking up.
