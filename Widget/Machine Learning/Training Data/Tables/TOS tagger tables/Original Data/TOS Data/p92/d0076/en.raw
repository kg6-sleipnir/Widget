Israeli warplanes continued to pound targets in the Gaza Strip on Monday as
Israel's Defense Minister declared an "all out war" against the Islamic
militant group Hamas and its Gaza government.  
Palestinian officials say Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 300 people
since Saturday, some of them civilians.  Israel says rockets launched from Gaza
against Israeli towns provoked the conflict.  
But some say the response has been disproportionate and may be an attempt by
Israel to restore its image.
