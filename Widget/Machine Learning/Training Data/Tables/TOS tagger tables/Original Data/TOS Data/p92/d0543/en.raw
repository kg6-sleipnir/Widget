The impoverished country of Afghanistan is pledging $100,000 to help the
victims of Hurricane Katrina in the United States.
U.S. Ambassador Ronald Neumann thanked the Afghan people for the pledge on
Sunday. He said the money "bears testimony to the strength of the ties between
our two peoples."
U.S. forces toppled the Taliban regime in Afghanistan after the 2001 al-Qaida
led terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington.
About 20,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan, which relies heavily on the
U.S. for financial aid.
