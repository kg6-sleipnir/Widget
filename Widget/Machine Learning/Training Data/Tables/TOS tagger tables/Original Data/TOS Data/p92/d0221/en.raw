A widely watched gage of future U.S. economic activity rose in October.
Monday's report from a business research group showed the index of leading
economic indicators growing nine-tenths of a point to 137.9.
The index is intended to predict economic performance three to six months in
the future.
The increase was more than economists expected and a change from the previous
month, which saw a decline.
Analysts say the labor market is recovering from the effects of recent
hurricanes.Â
