Afghan officials say security forces have found the dead body of a Turkish
engineer who was abducted by suspected militants Tuesday.
Interior Ministry official Jamil Jumbesh said the body was found in eastern
Afghanistan Wednesday, and appeared to have been shot several times.
The Turkish engineer was working on a road construction project between the
southeastern city of Jalalabad and Kunar to the east. Also abducted were his
driver and a translator. Both Afghan nationals were freed hours later.
