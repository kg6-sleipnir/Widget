Israeli troops have shot and killed a Palestinian teenager during an operation
in the West Bank.
The 16-year-old boy was killed as Israeli forces raided a building in the city
of Nablus. A military spokesman says the troops were forced to open fire after
a group of Palestinians threw stones and Molotov cocktailsÂ at them.
At least six other Palestinians were wounded.
The incident occurred as Israeli forces were attempting to capture two
Palestinians who are members of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an offshoot of
the Fatah movement.
