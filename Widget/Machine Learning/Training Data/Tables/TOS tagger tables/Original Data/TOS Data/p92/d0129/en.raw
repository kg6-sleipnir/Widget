An Australian archaeology team has located an ancient Egyptian city used by
foreign occupiers some 3,500 years ago.
Egypt's antiquities department says pictures taken by radar show an underground
city complete with streets, houses and temples.
It is located in an area in Egypt's Nile Delta.
Antiquities Chief Zahi Hawass says the ancient city could be part of Avaris,
the capital used by the Hyksos, an Asiatic group that ruled Egypt from 1664
through 1569 BC.
