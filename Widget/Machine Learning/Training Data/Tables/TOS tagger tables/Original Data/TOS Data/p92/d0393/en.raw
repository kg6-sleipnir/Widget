Two astronauts have resumed work outside the International Space Station on a
new European science laboratory.
Rex Walheim and Stanley Love began their spacewalk Friday morning, installing
science experiments, including a solar monitor, to the exterior of the Columbus
lab.
It is the third and final spacewalk during the U.S. shuttle Atlantis mission to
the orbital outpost. Walheim and Love installed the European Space Agency lab
Monday with help from crew inside the space station.
The Atlantis is set to return to Earth next week.
