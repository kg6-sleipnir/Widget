Yemeni officials say a suspected al-Qaida militant shot two police guards
Sunday in an unsuccessful attempt to escape the hospital where he was being
treated in the capital, Sanaa.

Hospital officials say the suspect grabbed a weapon from his guards and opened
fire, but failed to get out of the hospital.

Yemen intensified its fight against al-Qaida after a local branch claimed
responsibility for a failed bomb attack on a U.S.-bound airplane in December.

The United States has pledged millions of dollars in military aid to help the
country battle terrorism.
