The NATO-led force in Afghanistan says coalition forces killed at least 30
militants Saturday while fighting off an attack on a combat outpost.

The attack occurred early in the morning in the Bermal district of Paktika
province, bordering Pakistan.Â  NATO says militants surrounded the outpost,
firing from all directions with rocket-propelled grenades, small arms and
mortars.

Coalition officials said the embattled troops on the ground called in air
support to help repel the attack.

At least five coalition service members were wounded during the firefight, but
NATO says none were killed.
