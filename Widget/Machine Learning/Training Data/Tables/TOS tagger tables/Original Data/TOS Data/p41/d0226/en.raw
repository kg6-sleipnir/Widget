Ukrainian emergency officials say five people have been killed in the crash of
a small private passenger plane near Kyiv.
The Beechcraft turboprop was on a flight Sunday from the Czech Republic.
Witnesses say the plane crashed and exploded in a field just short of the
runway at Zhulyany airport near Kyiv. No one on the ground was hurt.
All five victims were Czech.
Investigators say initial findings point to human error as the cause of the
crash.
