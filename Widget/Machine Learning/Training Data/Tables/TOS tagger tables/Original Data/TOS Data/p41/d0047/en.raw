Humanitarian agencies report more than 50 people have been killed in floods in
Pakistan brought on by heavy monsoon rains that began earlier this month.

The Red Cross says 50,000 people have been affected in the worst hit areas in
the province of Baluchistan.

The Pakistani government and relief organizations are pledging food and
supplies to help those displaced by the flooding.Â  But there are concerns that
worsening weather conditions could hamper those relief efforts.
