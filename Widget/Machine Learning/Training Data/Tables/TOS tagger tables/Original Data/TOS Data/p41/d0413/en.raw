Millions of Americans could lose their homes this year and in 2009 as
foreclosures across the United States are occurring at the highest rate in
decades. At the beginning of the year, the number of homes facing foreclosure
jumped more than 57 percent compared to a year ago. The foreclosure crisis is
worsening despite ongoing efforts by some lenders and the federal government to
help borrowers manage the mortgage payments on their homes. VOA's Chris Simkins
reports on how one organization is helping people save their homes.
