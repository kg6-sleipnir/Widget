Pakistani officials said military fighter jets and helicopter gunships pounded
tribal areas in northwestern Pakistan on Sunday, killing at least 30 insurgents
and destroying seven militant hide-outs.

Pakistan launched the offensive in Orakzai to rout Taliban fighters from the
mountainous area near its border with Afghanistan.

Elsewhere in Pakistan's tribal region, suspected militants released 50 of the
60 people kidnapped at gunpoint in Kurram on Saturday.

Local officials say tribal elders are helping to negotiate the release of the
remaining hostages.
