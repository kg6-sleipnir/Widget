Argentina and Spain have agreed to pursue a strategic alliance to strengthen
political and economic ties.
Argentine President Nestor Kirchner and visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Luis Rodriguez Zapatero signed the agreement Tuesday in Buenos Aires.
Earlier this week, Mr. Zapatero met with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula
da Silva in Brasilia. The two said they plan to strengthen cooperation in
social development, construction projects and other fields.    
For the last leg of his South American trip, Mr. Zapatero is scheduled to fly
to Chile Wednesday to meet with President Ricardo Lagos.
