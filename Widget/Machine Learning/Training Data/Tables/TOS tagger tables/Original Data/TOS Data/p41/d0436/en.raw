Haiti hosts a donors conference Tuesday, hoping to secure at least $5
billionÂ in pledges to help the impoverished Caribbean nation jump start its
economy and make vital repairs to infrastructure.
Delegates at the conference will include representatives from the United
States, European Union, and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Haitian leaders say building roads, revitalizing agriculture, and boosting
education and health care services are their priority.
Haiti's economic problems continue and living standards remain low more than
two years after a rebellion that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
