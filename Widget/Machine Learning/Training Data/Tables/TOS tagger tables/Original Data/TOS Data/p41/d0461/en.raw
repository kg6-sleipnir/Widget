Authorities in Saudi Arabia say a fourth French national has died of wounds
suffered in an attack in northwestern Saudi Arabia.
Officials say a teenager died in a hospital Tuesday of wounds sustained when
gunmen shot at a group of nine French nationals who had stopped along a road on
Monday.Â  Three had died shortly after the attack.
A Saudi spokesman said the French nationals were residents of the Saudi kingdom
who had been visiting historic sites.
Saudi Arabia has been battling al-Qaida militants in the kingdom, and the
terrorist group has targeted Westerners in the past.
