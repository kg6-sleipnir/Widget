A British court has sentenced a Saudi prince to at least 20 years in prison for
beating and strangling his aide in a London hotel.

A judge on Wednesday told Prince Saud Abdulaziz bin Nasser al Saud that no one
is above the law.

Bandar Abdulaziz was found dead in a hotel room in February.

The prince had admitted to manslaughter, but denied intending to kill the man.

Prosecutors said the victim had been badly beaten and that his injuries showed
there was a "sexual element" to the attack.
