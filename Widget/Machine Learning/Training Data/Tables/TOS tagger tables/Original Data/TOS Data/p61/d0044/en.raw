southern city of Karachi on Saturday.
Officials had earlier said 43 people were killed in the storm, however, the
number increased when the bodies of 185 more victims were identified Sunday.
Many people were killed when the roofs and walls of their homes collapsed.
Others were killed or injured by power lines downed in the storm.
Weather forecasters expect the heavy rains to continue through Monday.
