The Goldman Environmental Prize is awarded to  environmental activists around
the world annually for what the Goldman foundation calls "environmental grass
roots heroism." The prize carries with it $150,000 and has been called the
nobel prize for the environment.  This year's winner from Europe is Belgium's
Ignace Schops.  VOA'S Paul Sisco has his story and the story of the national
park he helped establish.
