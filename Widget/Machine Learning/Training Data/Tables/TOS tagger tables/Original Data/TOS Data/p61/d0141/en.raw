Afghan authorities say seven Taleban prisoners have escaped from Afghanistan's
main prison and 10 guards are being investigated for helping them break free or
for negligence.
The director of Afghanistan's prisons said Tuesday, the men broke out of
Policharki Prison on the outskirts of the capital, Kabul, on Sunday.
He declined to identify the escaped prisoners, citing security reasons, but
said security forces were searching for them.
