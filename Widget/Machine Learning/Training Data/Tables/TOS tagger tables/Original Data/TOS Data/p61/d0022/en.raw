The city of Washington is widely known for a keen appreciation of the social
arts:  Politics, for example or the fine art of diplomacy. But an important

is called the "Color Field" movement, and it is the subject of a major new
exhibition now underway in the nation's capital.  As VOA's George Dwyer
reports, the passing of years appears to have cast this colorful school of
painting in a whole new light.
