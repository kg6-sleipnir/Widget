Pakistani police say multiple gas cylinder explosions tore through a building
in the city of Lahore, killing at least 24 people and injuring many more.
Witnesses say there were about 40 residents in the collapsed building, and that
most were asleep when the blasts occurred Tuesday morning.
Officials say rescue workers were searching for people who were believed
trapped in the rubble of the multi-story structure. Police say the building had
a gas cylinder storage area and an ice cream factory on the ground floor.
Several near-by buildings and a number of cars were also damaged.
