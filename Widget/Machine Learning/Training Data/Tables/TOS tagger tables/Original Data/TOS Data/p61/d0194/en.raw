Israeli police say Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's personal secretary has been
placed under house arrest for 10 days as part of a corruption probe - the
latest political scandal to rock the Jewish state.
A spokesman says Shula Zaken was among more than 15 people questioned Tuesday
in an investigation into government officials accepting or giving bribes in
return for tax breaks.
Tax officials were among those questioned.
Reports say Mr. Olmert has not been targeted in the probe.
The Israeli prime minister has been the subject of several previous corruption
investigations but has not been charged.
