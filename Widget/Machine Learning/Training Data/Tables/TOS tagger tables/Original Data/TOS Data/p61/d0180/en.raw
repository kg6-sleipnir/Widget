U.S. President Barack Obama has extended sanctions on Burma's military
government for another year.
Mr. Obama informed Congress of the decision Friday, saying Burma is "engaging
in large-scale repression of the democratic opposition."
He added that Burma's actions and policies are hostile to U.S. interests, and
they pose a continuing threat to U.S. national security and foreign policy.
The existing sanctions on Burma must be renewed annually. They were set to
expire next week.
