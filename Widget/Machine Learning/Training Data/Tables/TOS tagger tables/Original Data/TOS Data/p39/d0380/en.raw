U.S. stock markets are making strong gains in Friday's trading, with key stock
indexes up as much as three percent.

Traders are watching as the U.S. House of Representatives considers a massive
government-sponsored bailout plan for the financial sector.  

European markets also posted strong gains.

It was a different story in Asia, where Japan's benchmark Nikkei index fell two
percent, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down nearly three percent.
