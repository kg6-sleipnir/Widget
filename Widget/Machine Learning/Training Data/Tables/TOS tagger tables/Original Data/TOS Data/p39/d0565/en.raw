Sri Lanka's baby tsunami survivor has been reunited with his parents, ending
weeks of controversy.
The four-month-old boy, known as "Baby 81", was handed over to his parents in a
court Wednesday, after DNA tests confirmed the true parents.
Nine couples originally claimed the boy, but only one couple (Murugupillai and
Jenita Jeyarajah) formally filed for custody.
The infant was found alive among debris on Sri Lanka's east coast hours after
the tsunami struck on December 26.
