The Cannes Film Festival has named Hong Kong director Wong Kar WaiÂ as the head
of this year's international jury.
His selection marks the first time a Chinese film maker has headed the nearly
60-year-old awards festival.
Mr. Wong's 1997 film Happy Together earned him a best director award from the
festival. His other films include In The Mood For Love (2000) and the stylized
sci-fi movie 2047 (2004).
On Wednesday, festival organizers issued a statement from Mr. Wong in which he
said he is honored to serve as jury president.
