The president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries says the oil
cartel should keep producing the current amount of oil and consider raising its
quotas.
The comments came Monday from OPEC President Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah, who
is also Kuwait's oil minister.
OPEC officials are scheduled to gather in Iran on March 16 to discuss oil
supplies and prices.
World oil prices pushed above $52 a barrel Monday as forecasters said a winter
storm would dump significant snow on the northeastern part of the United
States, pushing up demand for heating oil.
