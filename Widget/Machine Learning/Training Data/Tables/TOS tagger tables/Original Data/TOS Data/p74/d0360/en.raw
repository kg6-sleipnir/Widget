Oil prices soared to a record high of $62.30 a barrel in New York trading on
Monday after Saudi Arabia's King Fahd died. In London, Brent crude also hit a
record high price $60.98 a barrel.
Prices rose more than $1.5, even though analysts expect no changes in Saudi oil
policy.
Saudi Arabia is the world's largest oil exporter and a key member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Rising demand and supply concerns have pushed oil prices upward by 40 percent
over the past year.
