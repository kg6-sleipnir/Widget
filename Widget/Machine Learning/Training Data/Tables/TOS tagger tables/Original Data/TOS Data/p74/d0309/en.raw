Heavy snow and strong winds have been blamed in the deaths of at least six
people across Japan.
Officials believe strong winds caused a high speed train to derail north of
Tokyo, killing at least one person. They say at least 16 others were injured
and taken to the hospital after the accident.
Blizzards and some of the heaviest snowfall on record for December have killed
at least five people since last week. The snow also disrupted public
transportation and left thousands without electricity.
