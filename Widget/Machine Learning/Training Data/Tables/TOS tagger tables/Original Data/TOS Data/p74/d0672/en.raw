Iranian television is reporting that there has been a large explosion near the
southwestern port city of Daylam in Bushehr province.
It was not immediately clear what caused the blast, but residents reported
seeing an aircraft overhead. State television says the explosion may have been
caused by a fuel tank dropping from an Iranian airplane.
Iran and Russia are building a nuclear reactor in Bushehr, about 150 kilometers
south of where Wednesday's explosion occurred.
