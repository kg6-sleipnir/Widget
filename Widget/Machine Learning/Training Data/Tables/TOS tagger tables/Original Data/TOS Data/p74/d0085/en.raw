Chinese officials say a gas explosion has trapped at least 50 coal miners deep
underground.
Officials say the blast occurred before dawn Thursday at a mine in northern
Hebei province.
The condition of the miners is not immediately known.
The latest accident in China's notoriously dangerous mines comes one week after
an accidental explosion killed 21 miners in Sichuan province in southwestern
China.
