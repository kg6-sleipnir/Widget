Palestinian officials say two Palestinians have been killed in an accidental
explosion in a West Bank refugee camp.
The officials say the accident happened early Monday in the Askar refugee camp
in the city of Nablus.
They say an old Israeli army shell exploded when a man and his son collecting
scrap metal tried to cut through it with a blowtorch, killing the two
Palestinians.
