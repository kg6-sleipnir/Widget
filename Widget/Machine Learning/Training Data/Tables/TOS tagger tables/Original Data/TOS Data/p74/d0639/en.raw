Uganda has dropped criminal charges against a U.S. evangelist and has instead
ordered his deportation.
Peter Waldron was arrested in February after police found assault weapons and
ammunition in his home. He was charged with weapons possession under the
country's terrorism law. Waldron has denied being a terrorist.
Prosecutors have not disclosed the reason for dropping the case.
