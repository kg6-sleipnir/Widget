Israeli-Arab lawmaker Azmi Bishara has announced his resignation from the
Knesset after leaving the country amid a police investigation.
Bishara says he tendered has resignation Sunday at the Israel Embassy in Egypt.
An embassy spokesman confirmed the move, saying Bishara had handed his
resignation to Ambassador Shalom Cohen at a meeting Sunday morning.
