Hundreds of Islamist students in Egypt have marched at three of the country's
universities to call for democratic reforms.
The demonstrators Sunday called on the government to ease restrictions on
political activities at universities, and to allow free and fair student
elections.
The protests took place on the campuses of Cairo, Ein Shams and Azhar
universities. Many of the protesters were supporters of the banned Muslim
Brotherhood movement.
