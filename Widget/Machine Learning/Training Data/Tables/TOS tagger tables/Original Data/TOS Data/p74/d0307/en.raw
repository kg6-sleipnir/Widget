International relief efforts are gearing up to provide emergency aid to the
victims of Sunday's disaster in Asia.
The United Nations says it has already dispatched a relief team and made an
initial cash grant.
Among the other offers of help, the European Union on Sunday committed $4
million for what officials called the vital period immediately after the
disaster.
Individual nations have also been responding with offers of immediate
assistance.
Pope John Paul, speaking in Vatican City, urged members of the international
community to mobilize assistance for victims.
