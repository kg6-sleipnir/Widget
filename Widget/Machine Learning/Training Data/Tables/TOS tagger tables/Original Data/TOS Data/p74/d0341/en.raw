President Bush has renewed a one-year ban on imports from military-ruled Burma.
A White House statement Tuesday says the ban is a sign of serious concern about
the Burmese regime's continuing refusal to move towards democracy.
The statement says the United States watches in deep dismay as a country of
Burma's beauty and potential deteriorates under the oppressive weight of the
military junta.
Burma's neighbors in the Association of Southeast Nations have recently
condemned the regime's lack of tangible progress on democratic reforms.
