Yemen has executed an Islamic militant convicted of killing three American
medical workers in 2002.
Authorities say a firing squad killed Abed Abdul Razak Kamel in the central
prison of Yemen's Ibb province Monday, one day after President Ali Abdullah
Saleh endorsed his death sentence.
Kamel opened fire on American medical staff at a Baptist hospital in the
southern Yemen town of Jibla. Authorities believe he may have been part of or
linked to a terror network.
