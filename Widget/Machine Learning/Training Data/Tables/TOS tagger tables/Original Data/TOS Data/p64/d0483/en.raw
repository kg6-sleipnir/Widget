World oil prices declined below $54 a barrel Friday after hitting records above
$58 early this week.
The easing of prices follows a U.S. government report on Wednesday showing an
increasing supply of crude oil in the U.S. market, and growing refinery
operations to turn out gasoline.
While prices have dropped, they are still about 44 percent higher than they
were a year ago.
Most economists surveyed by the Bloomberg financial news service say high oil
prices and rising interest rates will slow U.S. economic growth later this
year.
