Thousands of students in several Egyptian cities have protested the Israeli
army's killing of three Egyptian policemen on the Gaza border.
Students called on the government Sunday to reject Israel's apology and allow
Egyptians to wage holy war over the incident.
The Egyptian government has demanded a formal inquiry into the Thursday
shootings, in which Israeli troops said they mistook the policemen for
Palestinian insurgents.
Egypt has also suspended a planned trip to Israel by its Foreign Minister after
the killings.
