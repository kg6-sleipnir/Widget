 Israeli troops have shot dead a Palestinian militant in the West Bank.
Israeli army officials say soldiers killed Mahmoud Hammad, a member of the
militant group Islamic Jihad, as he tried to escape from a house in the village
of Raba, close to the West Bank town of Jenin.
They say the militant was carrying a weapon when he was shot.
Israeli troops have carried out frequent raids in West Bank cities and towns
targeting militants spearheading a four-year-old Palestinian uprising.
