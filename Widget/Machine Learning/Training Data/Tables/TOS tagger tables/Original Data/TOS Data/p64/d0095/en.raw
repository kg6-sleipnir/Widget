U.S. President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, spent a portion of the
Christmas holidays visiting troops and their families at a Hawaii Marine base.

The Obamas visited the same military base last year during their holiday
vacation in the president's home state.

Mr. Obama and the first lady are encouraging the public to support military
communities, especially during the holidays when separation from family can be
difficult.

Mrs. Obama says a "care package" or a simple "thank you" is an important gift
to members of the military.
