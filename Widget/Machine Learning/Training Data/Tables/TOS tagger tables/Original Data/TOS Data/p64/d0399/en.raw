Today, April 22 is Earth Day, a global event that began in 1970 and is credited
by some with giving birth to the modern environmental movement.  Earth Day grew
from an annual event in the United States to a global event in about 180
countries. It's a day of celebration in some places, but has also turned into a
day of action and reflection and conversation and sometimes protest about the
situation with our environment, particularly climate change.  VOA's Paul
Sisco has more.
