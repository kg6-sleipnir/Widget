A prominent leader of France's far-right has gone on trial for questioning
whether the Nazis used gas chambers in the Holocaust.
Bruno Gollnisch, the deputy leader of France's National Front Party, appeared
in court in Lyon to answer charges of "disputing crimes against humanity."
Gollnisch, a member of the European parliament, received a five-year suspension
from his post as a professor of Japanese at Lyon University after he made the
comments at a press conference in 2004.
He faces a possible one-year prison sentence if he is convicted.
