Mauritania has asked for international aid to help thousands of homeless people
after heavy rains caused mudslides in the eastern part of the country.
The country's finance minister, Abderahmane Ould Hamma Vezzaz, said Sunday
about 10,000 people in and around the town of Tintane were left homeless after
heavy rains that started last week.
Those rains caused mudslides that wiped out homes and businesses in much of the
town in southeastern Mauritania, near the border with Mali.
At least two people were reported killed in the mudslides and an unknown number
of others are missing.
