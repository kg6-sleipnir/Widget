When fireworks light the sky at the Beijing Olympics opening ceremonies, Cai
Guo-Quiang will be making art. This Chinese born artist who now calls New York
home creates artwork from fireworks and gunpowder. He is currently designing
the computer-controlled firework spectacle that will mark the start of the
Beijing games. 
Recently, his work was on display at New York's Guggenheim Museum in an exhibit
called I Want to Believe.  For producer Wang Yiru, Elaine Lu has the story.
