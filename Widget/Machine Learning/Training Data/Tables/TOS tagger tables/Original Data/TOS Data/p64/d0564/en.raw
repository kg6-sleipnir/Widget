President Bush has met with Jordan's King Abdullah at the White House
Wednesday.
The president said he and the Jordanian monarch had two good meetings over the
past two days, discussing Iraq, Iran and the Palestinian territories.
King Abdullah called the discussions "fruitful," and said he appreciates Mr.
Bush's desire to promote peace and stability in the Middle East.
The two leaders both rejected the violence triggered by cartoons depicting the
Prophet Muhammad, and at the same time called for all religions to be
respected.
