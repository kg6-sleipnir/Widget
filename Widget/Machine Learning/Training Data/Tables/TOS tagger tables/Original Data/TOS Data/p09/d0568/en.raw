Police in the western Indian state of Maharashtra say 26 women drowned after
two boats capsized in the Wainganga River late Saturday.

Local authorities say four women and two crew members managed to swim to
safety, but that eight women are still missing.

Police say the women - poor farm laborers on their way home from work - started
panicking after seeing a bolt of lightning.Â  Their panicked movements caused
the boats to capsize.

The accident happened in Bhandara district, some 925 kilometers northeast of
the state capital, Mumbai.
