An Ariane rocket has lifted off from Kourou, French Guiana, carrying seven
satellites, including at least one that is to gather intelligence for France's
military.
The Helios 2A military satellite, launched from the European Space Agency's
center, is to gather both optical and infrared intelligence.
The other satellites include the Parasol designed to study cloud formations in
the upper atmosphere.
