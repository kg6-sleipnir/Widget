 Authorities in Turkey have released five people who had been detained since
Saturday on suspicion of planning to attack Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip
Erdogan.

The Anatolia news agency said police rounded them up in the southern city of
Adana, shortly before the prime minister visited the city for an election
campaign rally.

Judicial officials did not say why the five were released, and provided no
details about the alleged plot.
