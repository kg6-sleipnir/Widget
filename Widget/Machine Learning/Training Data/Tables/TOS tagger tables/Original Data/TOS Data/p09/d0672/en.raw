China's first private airline is expected to take to the skies this year.
The official Xinhua news agency saysÂ Sunday Okay Airways is undergoing a final
official review, and should be cleared to begin operations after Nov. 20.
Xinhua said the Beijing-based airline plans to lease six U.S.-made Boeing 737
aircraft for domestic cargo and passenger charter flights.
Two other private airlines, United Eagle Airlines and Air Spring, reportedly
hope to begin flying next year, once a review of their applications is
completed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
