Turkish authorities say 20 people have been wounded in a bomb blast at a resort
in western Turkey.
The explosion occurred Sunday in the Aegean coastal town Cesme, a popular
tourist destination near the port city of Izmir. There has been no claim of
responsibility for the blast.
The regional governor said two foreigners were among the injured, but did not
identify their nationalities.
In April, a bomb attack in the nearby resort town Ksusadasi left a police
officer dead. A Kurdish separatist group claimed responsibility for that blast.
