Google, one of the Internet's most successful companies, is gearing up to
compete better with its popular rival, Facebook.

The Wall Street Journal reports Google is holding talks with makers of on-line
games in the hope of boosting profits by offering a new service to its many
customers.

Advertisers pay the Internet giants for the right to post advertising that
reaches the hundreds of millions of people who use the services.

The fast-growing on-line gaming sector of the industry could boost revenue by
attracting larger audiences and holding them for a longer time.
