Tony Blair
Russian officials say British Prime Minister Tony Blair will not attend the
upcoming World War II commemorations in Moscow.
The Kremlin Friday said Mr. Blair expressed regret that intensive work on
forming a new Cabinet would prevent him from attending the ceremonies Monday.
Mr. Blair's Labor Party on Thursday won a third straight general election
victory.
The Kremlin says Mr. Blair announced the decision in a phone call to Russian
President Vladimir Putin.
Dozens of world leaders, including President Bush, are to attend the events in
Moscow.
