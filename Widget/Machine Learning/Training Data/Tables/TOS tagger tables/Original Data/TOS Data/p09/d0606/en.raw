Five-time Olympic champion Ian Thorpe's of Australia return to competitive
swimming after a 15-month break lasted only one race at the World Cup meet in
Sydney.
The Australian star withdrew from the event Saturday due to illness after
clocking the fastest time in the qualifying race for the men's 100-meter
freestyle earlier in the day (47.87 seconds).
Australia's coach, Alan Thompson, said Thorpe had not been feeling well all
week, and had missed some training sessions.
Thorpe took an extended break from competition following the 2004 Athens
Olympics.
