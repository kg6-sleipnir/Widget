Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is expected Wednesday to present his proposals
for constitutional reform to the National Assembly.
Specific plans for the reforms have not been released, but Chavez has
previously said he would like to end presidential term limits. Currently the
president may serve no more than two six-year terms.
The National Assembly is expected to approve his changes, as it is controlled
by Chavez supporters.
If the plan passes the legislature, Venezuelan citizens must vote in a
referendum to accept or reject it.
