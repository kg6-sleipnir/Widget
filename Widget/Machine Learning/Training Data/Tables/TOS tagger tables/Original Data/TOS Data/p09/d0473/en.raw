An Israeli airstrike has killed five Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip.

Israeli military officials said on Saturday the five were preparing to launch a
rocket attack against southern Israeli communities when they were hit.

No other information was available on the militants' identities.

The militant Palestinian group Hamas controls the Gaza Strip where Israel has
routinely targeted rocket launchers.
