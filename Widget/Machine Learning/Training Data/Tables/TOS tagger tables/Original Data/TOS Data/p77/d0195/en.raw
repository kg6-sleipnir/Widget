Polish police have arrested more than 200 people in Warsaw, after supporters of
a Polish football team went on a rampage to celebrate their team's
championship.
At least 30 policemen were injured, as fans of Legia Warsaw smashed up shops
and outdoor cafes in the capital's Old Town quarter that is popular with
tourists.
Drunken fans hurled stones at police, who responded with tear gas and water
cannon.
Football-related violence has been a growing problem in Poland, prompting
concerns that Polish fans could cause trouble at next month's World Cup in
Germany.
