Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says the United States has denied visas to his
security staff, hampering his visit to the United Nations General Assembly in
New York.
Mr. Chavez says his still considering whether he will attend the U.N. summit,
which begins Wednesday.
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Caracas has denied Mr. Chavez's claim,
saying no visas were denied to the Venezuelan delegation.
Mr. Chavez has repeatedly accused the United States of trying to topple his
government, an accusation the United States has denied.
