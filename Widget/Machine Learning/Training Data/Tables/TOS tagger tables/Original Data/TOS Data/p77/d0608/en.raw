The Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts is home to many of New York's most
famous artistic organizations including the Metropolitan Opera, New York
Philharmonic and the New York City Ballet. Right now (through July 27) the
entertainment venue is hosting its annual Lincoln Center Festival, three weeks
of special performances from around the world. VOA's Behnam Nateghi has more on
