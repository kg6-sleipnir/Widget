Norway has pulled out of the Nordic Combined team event at the Turin Olympics
in Italy because nearly the entire team has become ill.
Norwegian spokesman Tom Dahl Froeshaug said Tuesday that only one member of the
four-man team is healthy enough to compete. He says an infection has swept
through the team that won the world championship last year.
The Nordic Combined event includes ski jumping off the large hill, and the 4x5-
kilometer cross-country ski race. The Norwegians are hoping to be ready for the
individual sprint competition next Tuesday.
