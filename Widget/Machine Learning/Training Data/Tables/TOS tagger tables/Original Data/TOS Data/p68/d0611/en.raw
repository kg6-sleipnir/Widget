Pakistani officials say they have arrested a foreigner suspected of links with
the al-Qaida terrorist network.
Officials say the suspect was arrested Monday night in a village, Charsadda,
northeast of Peshawar, about 50 kilometers from the Afghan border.
Pakistani security forces have rounded up dozens of suspected al-Qaida members
following the arrest of the network's reputed third-in-command, Abu Farraj al-
Libbi, earlier this month.
