An Islamic militant group in Iraq says it has taken a U.S. soldier hostage and
is threatening to kill him unless Iraqis held in U.S. prisons are freed within
72 hours.
A group calling itself the Mujahedeen Squadrons made the kidnapping claim and
demand in a statement posted on an Islamist website Tuesday, along with a
photograph of the alleged captive.
The Internet statement's authenticity could not be verified, and the U.S.
military said it could not confirm the claim.
