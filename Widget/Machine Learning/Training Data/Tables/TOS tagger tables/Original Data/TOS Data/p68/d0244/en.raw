Los Angeles is one of the world's most diverse cities, and a summer music
series there brings together the city's many ethnic communities. 
A recent performance by Seun Kuti, son of Afro-beat legend Fela Kuti, kicked
off this year's concert series, bringing the sounds of Lagos, Nigeria to
downtown Los Angeles. Six-thousand people came to celebrate the music and the
city's multi-cultural heritage.
