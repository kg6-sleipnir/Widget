Lawyers in Pakistan continued their protest marches this week amid an effort to
press the government to reinstate the judges replaced last year by President
Pervez Musharraf. After weeks of negotiations with his fellow coalition leader
Nawaz Sharif, Asif Ali Zardari says despite differences, he remains confident
the two parties will reach agreement. And some Pakistanis now living in the
U.S. say the new government cannot succeed without independent judges. VOA's
Ravi Khanna reports President Musharraf, so far, has made no public comment.
