Italy says an Italian photographer kidnapped in Afghanistan last month has been
freed.
Italy's Defense Ministry said Gabriele Torsello was released Friday. It gave no
details.
Torsello and his interpreter disappeared between October 12 and 14.
Torsello's kidnappers had said they would kill him if Italy's 18,00 troops were
not withdrawn from Afghanistan.
In western Herat province, suspected militants with machine guns killed six
policemen on patrol. The district police chief was among those killed, and
three police were wounded.
