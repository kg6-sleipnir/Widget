Crude oil prices fell Wednesday after a U.S. government report showed an
increase in inventories, reflecting decreased demand.

The price of a barrel of oil for future delivery fell 35 cents [about one
percent] to $38.68 a barrel during trading in New York.

The fall in prices followed a U.S. Energy Department report showing crude oil
supplies in the U.S. rose last week by 549,000 barrels, or about two-tenths of
one percent.
