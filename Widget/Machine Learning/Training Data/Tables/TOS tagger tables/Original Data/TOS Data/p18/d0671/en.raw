Two British lawmakers have called for an inquiry into claims that a British-
based security firm operating in Iraq withheld intelligence from British
troops.
The Guardian newspaper says the lawmakers want the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office to investigate whether the firm ArmorGroup directed an employee to
withhold information from British forces.
The probe demand follows a Guardian report that a former British policeman
working in 2004 and 2005 for the security firm in southern Iraq was told not to
share intelligence gained during visits to local Iraqi police stations.
The report says ArmorGroup has "vigorously" denied the claims.
