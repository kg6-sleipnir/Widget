Armenia has launched an aerial tramway line that it says is the world's
longest.

President Serzh Sarkisian attended the opening of the tramway Saturday, in the
country's southern mountains near Armenia's border with Iran.

The 5.7-kilometer engineering feat spans the Vorotan River gorge, linking a
village off the main highway to the 9th century Tatev Monastery.

The monastery is one of the country's oldest and most prominent monasteries and
is a major tourist attraction.
