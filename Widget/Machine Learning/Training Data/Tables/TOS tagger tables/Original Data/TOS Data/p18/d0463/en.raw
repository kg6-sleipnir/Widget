Russian police confirm that a shrapnel-packed bomb exploded Sunday in a
McDonald's restaurant in St. Petersburg, injuring six people.
The blast shattered windows and caused the ceiling to collapse. None of the
injuries was serious.
Investigators say the bomb was left under a table at the fast food restaurant
along Nevsky Prospekt, St. Petersburg's main street.
Authorities have not said if the attack was terrorist-related.
A car bombing of a Moscow McDonald's by Muslim extremists in 2002 killed one
person and wounded seven.
