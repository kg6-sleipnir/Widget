The U.S. military in Afghanistan says a U.S. Marine and an American solider
were killed in separate insurgent attacks Monday.
The military says the marine was killed when suspected Taleban insurgents fired
rocket-propelled grenades and mortars at a U.S. base near the eastern city of
Asadabad.
The military says the solider was killed when his unit came under similar
attack near the southern city of Kandahar.
The attacks occured just a week after Afghanistan held landmark general
elections. The election took place without any major violence despite Taleban
threats to disrupt the vote.
