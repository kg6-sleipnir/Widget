At 17, DeAndre Way became known around the world as Soulja Boy on the success
of his number one hit, "Crank That."   The song was also number one for seven
weeks on the iTunes digital download site in September 2007.  Despite the
criticism from other rap stars like 50 Cent and Jay-Z, Soulja Boy says the
numbers speak for themselves.  Larry London caught up with Soulja Boy on tour
in Washington.
