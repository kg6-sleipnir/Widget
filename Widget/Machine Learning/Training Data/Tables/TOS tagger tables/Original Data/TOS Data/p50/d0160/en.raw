Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taleban leader who fled to Pakistan after U.S.-led
forces routed his fighters in Afghanistan, has resurfaced with a message asking
all Muslims to join his fight.
Mullah Omar dropped out of sight in late 2001, but he is believed to be in
hiding somewhere near the Afghan-Pakistani border.
In a message distributed during the past several days in the southern Afghan
city of Kandahar, his former stronghold, the Taleban leader said his forces are
intensifying their fight against those whom he called foreign occupiers of
their homeland.
