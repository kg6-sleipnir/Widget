Chadian Prime Minister Pascal Yoadimadji has died in Paris at the age of 56.
Chad's ambassador to France says Mr. Yoadimnadji died Friday from a brain
hemorrhage. The prime minister was flown to Paris earlier this week after
suffering a heart attack.
Mr. Yoadimnadji was named prime minister in 2005 by Chadian President Idriss
Deby. He had previously served in the government as agricultural minister,
president of the national electoral commission and president of the
constitutional council.
