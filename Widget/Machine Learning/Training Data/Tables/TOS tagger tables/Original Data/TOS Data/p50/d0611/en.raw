Colombian police say suspected leftist rebels have executed at least seven farm
workers involved in coca harvesting in the southwest of the country.
Authorities say the attack was carried out Wednesday in the province of Narino
by gunmen from Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
They say the rebel group killed the farm workers as part of its battle for
ownership of lucrative coca fields used in the production of cocaine.
FARC militants have been fighting a long-running conflict with far-right
paramilitaries in the region, with each side trying to control drug smuggling
routes to Central America.
