At least seven Indian police officers were killed Sunday when their vehicle
struck a landmine in the eastern region of the country.

Officials say they suspect the bombs were planted by Maoist rebels.

The attack was in Orissa state, nearly 550 kilometers south of the state
capital Bhubaneshwar.

Indian officials say the long-running Maoist insurgency, which has spread to 20
of the country's 28 states, is India's most serious domestic security issue.Â 
The rebels, also called Naxalites, are demanding land and jobs for the poor.
