Usher is off the market. The multi-platinum R & B star is officially engaged to
his longtime girlfriend, stylist Tameka Foster.
Usher's publicist Simone Smalls made the announcement March 30, but provided no
further details. Usher had previously announced the engagement to MTV News.
The 28-year-old singer said he may be getting married by year's end. A five-
time Grammy Award winner, Usher has sold more than 35 million albums worldwide.
