China has confirmed an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu among wilds
birds in western China.
The Ministry of Agriculture said Friday that the outbreak was discovered in
Qinghai province after 123 birds were found dead.
The bird flu virus killed more than 1,000 geese in Qinghai last year. The
province is located along a major Asian migratory route for birds.
Researchers believe wild birds from the region may have carried bird flu along
migratory paths to Europe.
