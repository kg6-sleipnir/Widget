Pakistani warplanes have bombed suspected Taliban positions in the country's
northwest. Government officials say at least 19 militants were killed.
The officials say the air strikes Sunday targeted insurgent hideouts in the
Orakzai tribal region near the Afghan border.
Independent confirmation of the casualties is impossible because media access
to the region is restricted.
Since March, Pakistani forces have been carrying out an anti-Taliban offensive
in Orakzai to target militants believed to have fled an earlier offensive in
South Waziristan.
