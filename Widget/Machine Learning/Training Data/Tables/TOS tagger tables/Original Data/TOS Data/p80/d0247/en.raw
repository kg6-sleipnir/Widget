Israeli soldiers have killed two Palestinian gunmen who fired at them from a
demolished home in Hebron, on the West Bank.
Palestinian sources identified the men killed Thursday as members of the
Islamic militant group Hamas.Â  A third man was wounded in the exchange of
gunfire.
The house from which the men fired had been destroyed earlier in the day by the
Israeli troops.
In Gaza, a resident of the Rafah refugee camp died after an Israeli tank fired
at him. The Associated Press reports a second man was injured by the tank fire.
