Jane Fonda reportedly scolded her co-star Lindsay Lohan about her antics on the
set of their film Georgia Rules.
The veteran star is said to have sent Lohan a note taking her to task for
widely-publicized bad behavior.
Fonda's publicist denies reports that Lindsay Lohan is not welcome at the
film's May 7 premiere.
Held in Atlanta, Georgia, it will benefit the non-profit organization G-CAPP,
which Jane Fonda co-chairs.
