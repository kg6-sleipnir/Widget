Brazil and Argentina have announced they will build a pharmaceutical plant to
produce AIDS drugs and other medications.
Argentine officials made the announcement Wednesday in the Argentine capital,
Buenos Aires, after a meeting there between the two countries' health
ministers.
The $10-million drug plant is expected to be located on Argentine territory,
but both nations will contribute to the project.
The announcement came as Argentine President Nestor Kirchner met with his
Brazilian counterpart, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, in Brasilia.
