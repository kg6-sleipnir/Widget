A strong earthquake has hit southern Iran.Â  Officials expect some damage, but
there are no reports of casualties.
Iranian officials say the magnitude six quake was centered in a lightly-
populated rural area north of Bandar Abbas, a major port on the Persian Gulf.
Iran's state-run news agency reported at least two aftershocks, the strongest
measuring 4.8 magnitude.
Last November, a quake of 5.9 magnitude struck Qeshm island, south of Bandar
Abbas, killing nine people and injuring scores of others.
