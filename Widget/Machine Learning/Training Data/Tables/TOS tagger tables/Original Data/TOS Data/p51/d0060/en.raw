Venezuelan prosecutors want Colombia to extradite businessman Pedro Carmona,
who assumed power in Venezuela during a brief coup against President Hugo
Chavez in 2002.
Prosecutors provided evidence Monday detailing their accusations against
Carmona. They have requested that he be charged with civilian rebellion.
Venezuelan military officers arrested President Chavez in April 2002 and
announced his resignation after at least 17 unarmed protesters were shot and
killed during an anti-government rally.
Coup leaders installed Carmona as interim leader. He was forced out two days
later when military leaders withdrew their support and returned President
Chavez to office.
