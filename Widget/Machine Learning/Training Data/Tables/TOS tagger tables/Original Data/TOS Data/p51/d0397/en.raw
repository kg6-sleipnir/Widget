Estonian President Arnold Ruutel has formally approved the country's new
government, three weeks after the previous ruling coalition collapsed.
The president's action followed a parliamentary vote confirming Andrus Ansip
and his coalition government.
The 48-year-old Mr. Ansip was the minister of economics and communications
minister in the previous government.
The new coalition brings together Mr. Ansip's Reform Party, the Centre Party
and the People's Union.
Estonia's previous prime minister, Juhan Parts, resigned last month after
lawmakers voted no-confidence in his justice minister.
