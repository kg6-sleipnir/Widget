A California man has filed a lawsuit against Sean "Diddy" Combs, claiming the
rap mogul punched and pushed him and his girlfriend in a Hollywood nightclub.
Gerard Rechnitzer claims he and his girlfriend encountered Combs in Hollywood's
Roosevelt Hotel on February 25.
The lawsuit states Combs was speaking to Rechnitzer's girlfriend. As Rechnitzer
approached, Combs yelled at him and pushed him into a parked car. The March 2
lawsuit asks for unspecified damages. An attorney for Combs called the suit
"completely baseless."
