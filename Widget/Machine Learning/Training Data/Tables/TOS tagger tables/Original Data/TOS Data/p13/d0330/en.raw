El Salvador is preparing to send another contingent of 380 soldiers to Iraq.
Salvadoran President Antonio Saca said the troops will be participating in
humanitarian activities such as building water systems and other infrastructure
projects.
The French news agency, AFP,Â reports the latest troops will relieve an earlier
contingent stationed about 100 kilometers south of Baghdad.
El Salvador is the only Latin American country which still has troops in Iraq.
