Two years ago, war broke out along Israel's border with Lebanon. The conflict
known as the Second Lebanon War started after Hezbollah guerrillas attacked an
Israeli patrol and seized two Israeli soldiers.  On July 14, Hezbollah returned
the bodies of the two Israeli soldiers in a prisoner exchange with the Jewish
state.  No Israeli town was more affected by the war than Metullah, the closest
Israeli town to Lebanon.  Jim Teeple recently visited the town where many
residents say they want a lasting peace with Lebanon.
