Iraqi police say a roadside bomb exploded Thursday near a convoy carrying Abed
Theyab, the country's higher education minister.

Theyab escaped unhurt.

Officials say the blast occurred in central Baghdad. At least two civilians
were wounded in the attack.

Another roadside bomb blast in central Baghdad today killed an Iraqi security
official.

Violence in Iraq has fallen sharply in recent months, but roadside bomb attacks
are still a daily occurrence, often targeting soldiers, police and government
officials.
