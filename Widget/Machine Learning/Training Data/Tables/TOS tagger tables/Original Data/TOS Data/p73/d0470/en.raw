Romanian President Traian Basescu says authorities are working at home and
abroad to free three Romanian journalists who were apparently kidnapped in
Iraq.
Mr. Basescu's comments Wednesday came two days after 32-year-old reporter
Marie-Jeanne Ion, 30-year-old cameraman Sorin Dumitru Miscoci and 37-year-old
reporter Ovidiu Ohanesian disappeared in Iraq.
Ms. Ion managed to send a quick telephone message to her newsroom saying she
and the others were being kidnapped.
Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu says Romanian authorities have not received a
ransom demand.
