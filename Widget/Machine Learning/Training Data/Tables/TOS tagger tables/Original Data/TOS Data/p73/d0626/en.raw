Winning the women's European football championship has given Germany sole
possession of first place in the latest FIFA world rankings for women.
Previously, the Germans shared the top spot with the United States, which is
now second.
Germany defeated third-ranked Norway last Sunday in the European final, 3-1.
Brazil is the fourth ranked women's team and France is fifth.
Rounding out the latest top 10 are Sweden, South Korea, China, Denmark and
Italy.
