United Nations officials in Kosovo say an international police officer was
killed when a U.N. vehicle exploded Thursday in the town of Prizren.
Officials declined to give the name and the nationality of the victim. They
said an explosive device probably caused the blast, but said authorities are
still investigating.
U.N. police and NATO-led peacekeepers took over security duties in Kosovo in
1999,Â when the Serbian province became an international protectorate.
