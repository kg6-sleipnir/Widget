President Bush signed a new anti-genetic discrimination bill on May 22. He says
the act protects Americans against misuse of their genetic information by
employers and insurance companies. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the
legislation earlier this month with a near unanimous vote. Later, the Senate
unanimously approved it. VOA's Deborah Block reports.
