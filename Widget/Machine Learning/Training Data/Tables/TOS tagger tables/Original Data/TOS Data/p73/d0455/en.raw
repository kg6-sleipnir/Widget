The chief of Peru's prisons has resigned after newspaper allegations that he
betrayed the identities of two undercover agents working for the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration.
Benedicto Jimenez strongly denied the reports in Peru's El Commercio newspaper,
but handed in his resignation anyway.
The newspaper alleged that Jimenez tipped off jailed drug trafficker Fernando
Zevallos that he was under investigation by two agents working with U.S. drug
officials.
Neither the Peruvian nor U.S. governments have commented.
