Pakistani police say gunmen have shot and killed a Pakistani intelligence
official as he left a mosque following Friday prayers.
Police say the suspects shot the official Friday in Charsadda in northwestern
Pakistan and fled in a car.
The motive for today's killing was not immediately known.  It took place in a
region where pro-Taliban militants are active.
This is the third Pakistani intelligence official to be killed in recent
weeks.  Two were shot and killed late last month in the southern port city of
Karachi.
