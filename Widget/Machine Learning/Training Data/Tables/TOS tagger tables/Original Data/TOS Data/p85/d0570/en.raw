A court in Maluku province has sentenced a Muslim militant to death for his
role in sectarian attacks that killed at least eight people.
An Ambon district court judge Kharlison Harianja found Asep Jaya guilty of
involvement in terrorist acts and illegal possession of firearms.
Jaya was involved in attacks on a village and a police post that killed nine
people in 2004 and 2005. He has denied guilt and appealed Monday's verdict.
Violence between Christians and Muslims has killed more than five thousand
people since 1999 on Ambon and surrounding islands in the Maluku chain.
