Pakistani military officials say a suicide bomber has killed five soldiers and
wounded at least five others near the Afghan border.
The bomber detonated his explosives Thursday in South Waziristan's main town of
Wana.
It is unclear which group planned the attack, although al-Qaida and Taliban
militants are active in the tribal region.
