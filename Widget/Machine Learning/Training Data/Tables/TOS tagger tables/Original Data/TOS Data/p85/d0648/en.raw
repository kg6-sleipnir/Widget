The bestselling book Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is based on a true
story of murder in the southern city of Savannah, Georgia. Hollywood turned it
into a movie - making the crime's location, a historic building known as Mercer
House, a major tourist attraction. For producer Roger Hsu, Elaine Lu has more
on the house and the story that captivated the city.
