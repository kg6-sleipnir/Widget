Witnesses in Somalia say the brother of the country's deputy prime minister has
been shot dead by government forces.
The witnesses say the brother, Abukar Abdisalam, was talking on a mobile phone
outside his home in the capital, Mogadishu, when government troops became
suspicious, chased him and shot him.
Abdisalam is a brother of Ahmed Abdisalam Adan, who is also the country's
information minister.
The motive for the shooting is unclear.
