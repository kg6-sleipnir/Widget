A British Royal Air Force doctor has appeared in a military court and pleaded
not guilty to five charges of failing to comply with orders after refusing to
go to Iraq.
The Flight Lieutenant Malcolm Kendall-Smith refused to attend training in
advance of deployment to Basra last year. He said he believed the 2003 U.S.-led
invasion of Iraq was illegal.
The prosecutor told the court the presence of British forces in Iraq was not
unlawful.
The officer had already completed tours of duty in Iraq.
