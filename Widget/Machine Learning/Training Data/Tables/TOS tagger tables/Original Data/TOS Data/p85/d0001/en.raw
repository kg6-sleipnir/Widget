Disturbia remains the United States' top box-office attraction. The peeping tom
thriller took in $9.1 million last weekend, raising its three-week total to
$52.2 million.
Analysts say U.S. filmgoers are saving their money in anticipation of a series
of warm-weather blockbusters.
Leading the pack is Spider-Man 3, which premieres May 4. Both of its franchise
predecessors set box office records when they opened in 2002 and 2004.
