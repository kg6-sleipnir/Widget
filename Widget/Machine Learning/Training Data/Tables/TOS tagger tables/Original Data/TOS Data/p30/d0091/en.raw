Somali elders in the north of the country say pirates have released two German
hostages who were kidnapped more than six weeks ago.

The Germans were freed Friday.  Elders say a ransom was paid for the two.

They are now in the Somalia's main port city Bossaso and are expected to be
flown out of the country soon.

They were abducted from their yacht off the coast of Yemen when they were
traveling to Thailand.

Piracy is rife along Somalia's coast and has increased over the last year.
