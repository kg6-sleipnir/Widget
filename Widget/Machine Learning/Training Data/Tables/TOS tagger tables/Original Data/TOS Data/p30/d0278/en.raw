Pakistani officials say U.S. drone aircraft have fired missiles into a
suspected militant compound in the country's northwest tribal belt, killing at
least 10 militants.
The strike took place in Datta Khel, about 45 kilometers west of Miranshah, in
the North Waziristan district.
Elsewhere Sunday, Pakistani army helicopter gunships pounded suspected
insurgent hideouts in the Shana Garhi area of neighboring Orakzai tribal
region, and officials say at least eight militants were killed.
Pakistan's northwestern tribal areas are considered strongholds of al-Qaida and
the Taliban.
