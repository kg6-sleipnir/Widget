Militants in Iraq detonated several roadside bombs Friday, killing at least two
people and injuring eight others.
Police in Iraq say insurgents set off a bomb near a U.S. Army convoy in
Baghdad's exclusive Mansour district. The explosion killed one person and
wounded at least five others -- some seriously.
Across town, a bomb targeting Iraqi National Guard troops killed one person and
wounded at least three others.
The attacks followed twin suicide car-bomb blasts Thursday that killed at least
15 people and wounded more than 30 others.
