A U.S. soldier has been killed and four others wounded in a bomb attack in
southeastern Afghanistan.
The U.S. military says the troops were conducting security operations when the
blast occurred Friday in Paktika province, near the border with Pakistan.
American casualties have been mounting amid a major upsurge in violence across
Afghanistan ahead of legislative elections scheduled on September 18.
