An Indonesian health official says a chicken seller suspected of being infected
with bird flu has died at Jakarta's infectious diseases hospital.
A hospital spokesman said the 22-year-old dead man had a history of contact
with poultry.
Indonesian authorities say their tests indicate the man was infected with the
deadly H5N1 strain of the avian flu virus.
If the World Health Organization laboratory in Hong Kong confirms the case, the
man will be Indonesia's 15th fatality from avian influenza.
