The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and the consulates in Jeddah and
Dhahran will be closed on Monday and Tuesday due to terror threats against U.S.
government buildings in the kingdom.
An embassy statement urges U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia to maintain a high
level of vigilance. It says there is no specific information about the timing
or targets in any possible attacks. But it notes that terrorist groups in the
past have targeted housing compounds and other facilities frequented by
Westerners.
