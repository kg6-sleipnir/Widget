Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo says a law approved by parliament to allow an
opposition leader to run for president must be put to a referendum, angering
rebels who say he is wrecking peace efforts. 
 
The rebels say the reform should be enacted into law immediately.
 
The law to allow opposition leaders to run for president has been a key demand
among those who want former prime minister and opposition leader Alassane
Ouattara to make a bid for the presidency. 
 
It is designed to end a ban on Ivorians with foreign parents from running as
presidential candidates.
