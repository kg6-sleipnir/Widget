Egyptian police say they have killed one of the main suspects in the recent
bombings at Egypt's Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
A police official says Mohammed Saleh Fulayfill was killed and his wife was
wounded during a shootout with police near the town of Suez.
The July 23 bombings at Sharm el-Sheikh killed at least 64 people.
The suspect was also being tried in his absence for his alleged role in similar
bomb attacks last October in the Egyptian resort town of Taba.
