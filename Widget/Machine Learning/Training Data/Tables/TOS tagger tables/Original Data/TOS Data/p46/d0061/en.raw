Argentinean authorities say they have arrested a Colombian model accused of
leading a drug-trafficking ring.

Authorities say they detained Angie Sanclemente Valenica on Wednesday in
Argentina's capital Buenos Aires.

Valencia, a former beauty queen, had been accused of heading a group of
attractive young women that smuggled cocaine to Mexico.

Valencia has denied the charges.

Her native Colombia is the world's largest cocaine producer.
