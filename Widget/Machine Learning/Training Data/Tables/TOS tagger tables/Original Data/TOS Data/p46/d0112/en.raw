Taiwan says it has arrested a military intelligence officer who allegedly
provided defense secrets to China.
A defense ministry spokesman says the officer worked in a division responsible
for collecting information about China's military capabilities. His activities
were uncovered during an investigation into a crime ring involving fake credit
cards.
The spokesman says the information the officer passed on to Beijing dealt with
the mainland and not Taiwan, and was non-essential.
