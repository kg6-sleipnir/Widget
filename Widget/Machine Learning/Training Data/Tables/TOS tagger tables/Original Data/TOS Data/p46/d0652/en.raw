Pakistan has re-opened a route critical to transporting supplies to NATO and
U.S.-led forces in neighboring Afghanistan.

Local officials say Pakistani security forces escorted a convoy of about 30
food trucks and oil tankers through the Khyber Pass Monday.

Pakistan closed the route last week after gunmen hijacked about 15 supply
trucks destined for Afghanistan.

Security along the countries' mountainous border is a major concern for U.S.-
led troops fighting Taliban and al-Qaida militants in Afghanistan.Â
