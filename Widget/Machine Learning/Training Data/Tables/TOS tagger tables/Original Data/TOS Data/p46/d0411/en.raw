Pakistani security officials say they have detained a suspected Taliban
commander and killed at least five other militants during an operation in the
country's northwest.

Officials say security forces clashed with the insurgents Thursday in the
Mohmand tribal region, bordering Bajaur, where Pakistani troops have been
fighting Taliban and al-Qaida militants for months.

Authorities say the security forces captured a suspected explosives expert and
Pakistani Taliban commander, known as Imran or Mansoor, during the clash today.

They say the commander helped prepare suicide bomb materials and maintained
links with insurgents across the border in Afghanistan.
