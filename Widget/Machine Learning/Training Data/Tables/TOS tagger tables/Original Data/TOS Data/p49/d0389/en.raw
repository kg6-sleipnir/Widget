Authorities in Haiti have killed at least one person during a protest by
supporters of ousted former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
Thousands of protesters marched in the Bel-air section of Port-au-Prince to
demand the return Mr. Aristide, who has been in exile in South Africa since
last February.
Authorities opened fire on the crowd as they entered an intersection in Bel-
air. Few other details were given.
Violence in Port-au-Prince's pro-Aristide slums has killed more than 200 people
in the last four months.
