The U.S. Defense Department says U.S. and North Korean officials have reached
agreement on a framework to recover the remains of American servicmen missing
from the Korean War.
Two days of talks in Bangkok were led by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense Jerry Jennings.
The agreement reached Thursday will mark the 10th consecutive year that U.S.
specialists have carried out remains recovery missions in North Korea. The
remains of more than 200 soldiers have been recovered since 1996.
Of the 88,000 Americans missing from all conflicts, more than 8,100 are from
the Korean War.
