Leaders of 53 Commonwealth nations have gathered in the Mediterranean island of
Malta for a summit.
The Commonwealth's three-day biennial meeting is set to begin Friday.
Most, but not all, members of the Commonwealth were once part of the British
Empire.
Member nations include developed countries such as Australia and Canada,
developing nations including India and Pakistan, and island nations such as
Vanuatu.
Almost one-third of the world's population lives in Commonwealth member
nations.
The Commonwealth says the group's values include democracy, good governance,
equality and economic development.
