Iran says it is donating $50 million to the Hamas-led Palestinian government,
to ease a Palestinian cash crisis spurred by Western aid cuts.
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki announced the donation Sunday
during a conference in Tehran.
The promise of funding comes after the United States and the European Union
said they were stopping aid to the Hamas government because it refuses to
renounce violence and accept Israel.
Israel is withholding about $50 million in monthly payments of tax revenues it
collects for the Palestinian Authority.
