Sinbad is alive and well. The 50-year-old actor-comedian says he "rose from the
dead" last week, after Wikipedia mistakenly proclaimed his demise.
An editor on the vast Internet site posted that Sinbad had succumbed to a heart
attack. Email links of the erroneous page were forwarded nationwide before
other members of the Wikipedia community corrected the mistake.
Sinbad, whose real name is David Adkins, says he's not upset at the error -
although he wouldn't mind an apology from Wikipedia headquarters in St.
Petersburg, Florida.
