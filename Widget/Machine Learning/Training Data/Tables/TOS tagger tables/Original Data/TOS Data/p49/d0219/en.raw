Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez arrived in Iran Wednesday for talks with
officials on bilateral issues.
Reports say he is expected to meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
on Thursday as well as launch a joint development bank and bilateral investment
fund.
Mr. Chavez' visit to Iran follows a meeting with Latin American and Arab
leaders in Qatar. The Venezuelan president has made several trips to Iran since
Mr. Ahmadinejad took power in 2005. Both leaders have forged close ties.
Later this week, Mr. Chavez heads to Asia for talks with regional leaders.
