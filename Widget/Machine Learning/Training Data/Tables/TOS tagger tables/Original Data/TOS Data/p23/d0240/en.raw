Police in Afghanistan say Afghan and NATO forces have killed 10 Taleban rebels
in fighting in the country's south.
Police say the fighting broke out when Afghan and NATO forces raided the
rebels' hideouts in Helmand province's Garmser district.
It is the same area where, on Tuesday, Afghan and NATO forces killed 18 Taleban
insurgents. One police officer was also killed.
NATO took over security operations from U.S.-led coalition forces this week in
six southern Afghan provinces.
