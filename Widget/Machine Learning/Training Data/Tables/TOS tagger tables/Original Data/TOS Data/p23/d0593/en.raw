Kurdish witnesses in northwestern Iran say security forces killed at least 11
Kurdish demonstrators in a clash Wednesday in the city of Saqiz.
Witnesses tell VOA that government buildings in the town were damaged in the
clash.Â  They say police are heavily deployed across Saqiz.
The Iranian government has not commented on the reports.
The protest and clash are the latest in a wave of violence across Kurdish areas
of Iran following last month's killing of a Kurdish activist by Iranian
security forces.
