U.S. military officials say five Americans are being held in Iraq under
suspicion of terrorist activity.
Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman declined to identify any of the detainees. But
news reports said three of them are Iraqi-Americans, one is an Iranian-American
and the fifth suspect is Jordanian-American.
Mr. Whitman said none of them have been charged with a crime and that there is
no connection between the suspects.
The Iranian-American has been identified by his family as Cyrus Kar of Los
Angeles. His laywers have sued the U.S. government in an effort to secure his
release.
