Jordan has announced that parliamentary elections will be held on November 9.

The date was set in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.

It comes nearly a month after the government enacted a new election law
increasing the number of seats from 110 to 120.Â  It also doubled the quota of
women lawmakers to 12.

Jordan's King Abdullah dissolved parliament last year after accusing lawmakers
of ineffectiveness.
