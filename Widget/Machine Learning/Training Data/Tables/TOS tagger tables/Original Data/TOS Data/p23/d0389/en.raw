Russia says it has conducted a successful test launch of an interceptor missile
from a testing range in Kazakhstan.
A spokesman for the Russian space forces, Alexei Kuznetsov, said the launch on
Tuesday was part of a program aimed at extending the service life of
interceptor missiles in the country's defense system.
Kuznetsov told the Interfax news agency that initial information indicates that
the tests confirmed the missile's main characteristics.
Interceptor missiles are designed to shoot down enemy missiles. Russia
conducted a similar test in 2004.
