The U.S. space agency's Mars probe is set to land Sunday, May 25.  NASA
scientists in Washington recently talked about what they call the mission's
"seven minutes of terror." That is how long it will take for a probe to slow
down enough to land on its surface. Once there, the Phoenix Mars Lander will
dig into the Martian ice and soil, study the planet's atmosphere, and more.
