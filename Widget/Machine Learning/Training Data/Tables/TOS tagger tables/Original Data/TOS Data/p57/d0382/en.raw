A congressman from South Carolina has urged his colleagues and President Bush
to provide better equipment to troops in Iraq.
Representative Jim Clyburn said in the Democratic party's weekly radio address
that U.S. soldiers should never lack proper equipment nor accurate
intelligence.
Mr. Clyburn also said he opposed attempts to invest Social Security on the
stock market, calling proposed plans a gamble that could jeopardize benefits
for children.
He also called for expanding health insurance coverage and making college
education more affordable.
