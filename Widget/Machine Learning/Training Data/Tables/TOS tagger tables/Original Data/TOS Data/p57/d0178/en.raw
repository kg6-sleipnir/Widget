World oil prices hit new record highs Wednesday, as experts worried about
production problems that could disrupt output.
Those concerns include refinery breakdowns and a worse-than-usual hurricane
season that could threaten vital offshore wells. 
The production problems come as traders say there is robust demand for oil from
growing economies.
In New York, the price of crude oil for September delivery went as high as
$62.47 a barrel.  London's benchmark Brent contract also hit a new record high
of $61.25.
