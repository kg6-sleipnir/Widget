Kenyan authorities report that more than 1,000 teachers have been fired during
the past two years for sexually abusing girls.

Education officials said the teachers have been dismissed for impregnating
students and committing other sexual offenses.  More of the cases have occurred
in public schools.  

In addition to being fired from their jobs, some of the teachers have faced
criminal proceedings in courts.

Officials said more than 500 teachers have been fired so far this year for
committing sexual abuses, and that 600 were dismissed last year.
