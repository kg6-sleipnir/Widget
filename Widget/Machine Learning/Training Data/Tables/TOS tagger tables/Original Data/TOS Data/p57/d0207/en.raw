A moderate earthquake struck central Mexico Friday, forcing residents and
office workers to evacuate buildings in Mexico City.
Officials say no major injuries or damages were immediately reported.
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the earthquake's magnitude at 6.0. An
aftershock that measured 5.5 hit a few hours later.
The center says the earthquake, which hit Friday morning local time, was
centered in the southwestern state of Michoacan, about 200 kilometers southwest
of Mexico City.
In 1985, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in Mexico City killed more than 10,000
people.
