Iraqi medical officials say seven people have been killed in fresh clashes
between Shi'ite fighters and U.S. forces in Baghdad's Shi'ite stronghold of
Sadr City.
At least 20 other people were wounded in Thursday's fighting.
U.S. and Iraqi forces have fought fierce battles in Sadr City against Shi'ite
militiamen loyal to radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr for the past month.
