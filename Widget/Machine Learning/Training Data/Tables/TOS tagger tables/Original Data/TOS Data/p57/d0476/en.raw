Argentina has designated China as a "market economy," a move that will limit
the South American country's ability to impose anti-dumping sanctions on
Chinese exports.
The decision comes after China and Argentina signed accords that could bring
more than $20 billion in Chinese investment to Argentina over the next 10
years.
Brazil also granted China "market economy" status during a visit by Chinese
President Hu Jintao last week.
On Wednesday, Argentina's agriculture department announced that China will
increase imports of Argentine beef, apples and pears over the next few years.
