China's state-run media say a 19-year-old Chinese soldier has been hospitalized
with bird flu.
It is not immediately clear if the soldier has been infected with the often
deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu.
Fifteen people have died in China since the outbreak in 2003. Worldwide, the
virus has killed 186 people, mostly in Southeast Asia.
The virus is mainly passed on to humans through contact with infected poultry.
But experts fear the virus could spark a pandemic if it mutates into a form
easily transmissible upon human to human contact.
