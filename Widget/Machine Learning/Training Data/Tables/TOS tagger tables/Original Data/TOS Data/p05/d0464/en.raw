Palestinian officials say security forces have arrested two Palestinian
militants over rocket attacks on Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.
Authorities said Friday the members of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades were
detained for questioning. The group is loosely affiliated with the ruling Fatah
movement.
An al-Aqsa spokesman confirmed that two of the group's militants had been
detained.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas recently vowed to use an "iron fist"
against militants to enforce a truce between Israel and the Palestinians.
