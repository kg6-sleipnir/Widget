Turkish authorities say troops killed 10 Kurdish rebels in two operations since
Monday.
The officials say seven rebels were killed in fighting with soldiers in Siirt
province. 
Three other rebels were shot and killed in Van province.  Authorities believe
the three entered the area from Iran.
Turkey's military has recently intensified operations against the separatist
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast
since 1984.  The United States, the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK
as a terrorist group.
