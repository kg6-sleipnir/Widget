The trial of Saddam Hussein and seven co-defendants has resumed in Baghdad
after a five-day break.
The prosecution is presenting experts Monday, in an effort to confirm
signatures of the former Iraqi leader and his co-defendants on documents
related to the crackdown on Shi'ites in the 1980's.
The chief judge, Raouf Abdel Rahman, ruled last Wednesday that Saddam's
handwriting was authentic on documents related to the incident.
The ousted Iraqi dictator and the seven co-defendants are on trial for the 1982
killing of more than 140 Iraqi Shi'ites in the village of Dujail.
