Pakistani officials say security forces have killed at least 23 militants in
fighting that took place during a search operation in the country's northwest.

The clash took place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on Tuesday, a day after
militants launched a suicide bomb attack near a paramilitary base, killing one
soldier.

Officials say Tuesday's gunbattle began when militants opened fire on troops
searching the area.

Pakistan's military carried out a major offensive against the Taliban in Lower
Dir and neighboring Swat Valley last year.
