The price of crude oil dropped more than two percent in New York trading
Wednesday, falling to the lowest level in about a month.

The price of a barrel of crude oil for future delivery was off nearly $2 and
went as low as $73.83. Â 

The decline came as a government report said the total supply of crude oil and
refined fuels in the United States was more than 1.1 billion barrels, the
highest level in at least two decades.

An abundant supply of petroleum products generally pushes prices downward.
