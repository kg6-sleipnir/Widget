Indian police say they have arrested a key suspect in the July train bombings
that killed nearly 200 people and wounded more than 800 others in Mumbai,
formerly known as Bombay.
Police say they arrested Asif Khan, who used the alias Junaid, in the Indian
city of Belgaum in Karnataka state Tuesday.
They say he is one of the organizers of the attack.
He is the 16th person to be arrested in connection with the Mumbai blasts, and
was scheduled to appear in court Wednesday.
