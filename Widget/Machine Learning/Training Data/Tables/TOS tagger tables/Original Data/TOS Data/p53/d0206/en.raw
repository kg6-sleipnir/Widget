The U.S. government has chartered three of Carnival Cruise lines ships for the
next six months to provide temporary housing for victims of Hurricane Katrina.
Carnival officials say the ships will be able to provide shelter for as many as
7,000 people displaced by Katrina.
Two of the cruise liners will be based in Galveston, Texas and the other will
likely be docked in Mobile, Alabama.
