Indian officials say a bomb blast killed eight people and wounded at least 12
others Sunday, a day after the device was discovered in the eastern state of
Bihar.

Police in the Aurangabad district say the bomb was found Saturday but could not
be immediately defused.  

Local officials believe the bomb was planted by Maoist rebels who had called
for a boycott of Saturday's state legislative elections.
