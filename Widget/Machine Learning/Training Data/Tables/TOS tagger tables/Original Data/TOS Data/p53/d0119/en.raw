The Ford Motor Company says sales of its products in China are booming.
In a statement Monday Ford says sales rose 46 percent last year to more than
82,000 vehicles - a record.
If Ford's affiliated brands - like Mazda - are added to the total, the company
sold 220,000 vehicles in China last year.
Ford is the second largest U.S. automaker, and number three in the world after
General Motors and Toyota. In China, Ford is outsold by both GM and Volkswagen.
