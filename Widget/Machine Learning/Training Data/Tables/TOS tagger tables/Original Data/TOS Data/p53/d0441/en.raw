The family of former French prime minister and prominent economist Raymond
Barre says he has died at the age of 83.
Relatives said Barre died Saturday at the Val-de-Grace hospital in Paris, where
he had been hospitalized since April with heart problems.
Mr. Barre served in the Industry Ministry from 1959 through 1962 during
President Charles de Gaule's administration.
He was prime minister of France from 1976 through 1981, and also held the posts
of vice president of the European Union, French economics minister and mayor of
Lyon.
He retired from politics in 2002.
