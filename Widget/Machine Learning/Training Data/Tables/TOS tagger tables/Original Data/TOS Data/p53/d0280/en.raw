 Long before the Olympic games in Beijing dazzled the world, China had
generated interest among filmmakers.  One of those filmmakers is Sue Williams,
who has produced a number of documentaries about China in the last two
decades.  Her latest work "Young & Restless in China" has been broadcast on
Frontline, a program which airs on PBS, an American television network.
VOA's Yi Suli talked recently with Sue Williams about her interest in China. 
Elaine Lu narrates.
