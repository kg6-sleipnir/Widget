London police say they have arrested a 36 year-old man in connection with the
failed July 21 bombings in the British capital's public transport system.
No more details about Tuesday's arrest were immediately available.
Four other suspects are already in British custody over the attempted attacks,
in which no one was hurt.
The July 21 incidents came two weeks after another set of bombings killed 56
people, including four suicide bombers, in the London public transport system.
