At least four people have been killed in fighting between suspected Islamic
militants and government troops in Indian-controlled Kashmir.
The battle erupted on Saturday after police cordoned off a village looking for
suspected rebels.
Reports quote police officials as saying two militants and a senior commanding
officer are among the dead. Several people were injured and a few residential
homes were gutted.
Indian police tightened security in the area after the gun battle ended.
Rebel Islamic groups have fought since 1989 for an independent Kashmir or its
merger with Pakistan.
