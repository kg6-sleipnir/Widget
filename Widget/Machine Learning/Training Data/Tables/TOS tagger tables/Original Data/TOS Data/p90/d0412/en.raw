Afghan election officials have announced the final results from September
parliamentary elections that were marred by fraud and irregularities.

The country's Independent Election Commission said Wednesday all 11 seats in
Ghazni province would go to members of the Hazara ethnic group, with no
representation by the larger Pashtun population.

Most polling stations in Ghazni were shut due to insecurity during the
September 18 vote. Widespread reports of fraud delayed the release of the final
tally.

Election officials have disqualified 24 election winners nationwide and
invalidated nearly a quarter of the 5.6 million votes that were cast.
