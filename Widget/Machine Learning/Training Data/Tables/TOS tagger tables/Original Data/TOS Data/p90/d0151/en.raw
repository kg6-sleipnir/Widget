Police in India have arrested two men on suspicion of involvement in last
month's bombing on an India-to-Pakistan train that killed 68 people.
Authorities say the two were picked up Tuesday in the central Indian city of
Indore. Police say they believe the men are connected to the purchase of the
suitcases that contained the bombs.
The cross-border train was firebombed February 18 as it headed from New Delhi
to Pakistan.
Indian authorities say they suspect Pakistani militants were behind the attack.
