Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has returned home, three weeks after
undergoing gallbladder surgery in a German hospital.

The 81-year-old leader arrived at an airport in Sharm el-Sheikh Saturday, and
was greeted by senior government officials.

Authorities said Mr. Mubarak resumes his presidential duties upon his return to
Egypt.

President Mubarak temporarily handed over power to Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif
before undergoing surgery in Heidelberg, Germany on March 6.   Doctors removed
his gall bladder and a growth in his small intestine.

He has served as Egypt's president for more than two decades.
