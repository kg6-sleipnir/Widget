The United Nations Security Council has endorsed a call for talks on the
political future of the breakaway Serbian Province of Kosovo.
In a formal statement released in New York Monday, the Security Council said it
supports Secretary-General Kofi Annan's call for such talks.
The United Nations has administered Kosovo since 1999, since NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia forced Yugoslav and Serbian security forces from the area.
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority seeks independence, but Serbian authorities
want the province to remain part of Serbia.
