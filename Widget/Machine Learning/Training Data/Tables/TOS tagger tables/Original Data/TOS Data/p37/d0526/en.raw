Iraqi officials say a series of bombings at a sports facility in the
predominately Shi'ite Turkmen town of Tal Afar killed at least 10 people
Friday.

Investigators say the blasts took place at a field where a crowd had gathered
to watch a football match.

Police say an attacker drove a vehicle near the crowd and detonated
explosives.Â  They say two other suicide bombers then detonated explosives near
spectators.

Authorities say more than 100 people were wounded.

Tal Afar is located in northern Iraq, near the city of Mosul.
