Venezuela's National Assembly has voted to approve a request by President Hugo
Chavez to allow him to enact laws by decree for one year.

Lawmakers voted in President Chavez's favor Tuesday following the first
discussion on the proposal. Reports say a final vote on the controversial
measure is expected later this week.

Vice President Elias Jaua made the request earlier in the day on behalf of the
president. The measure was presented to the outgoing National Assembly, which
is dominated by President Chavez's allies.
