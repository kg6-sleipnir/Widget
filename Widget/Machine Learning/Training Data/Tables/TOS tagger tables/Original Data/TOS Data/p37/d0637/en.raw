The European Union plans to re-impose sanctions on as much as $4 billion worth
of U.S. goods after the World Trade Organization ruled that Washington has not
ended illegal tax breaks for U.S. exporters.
A WTO panel issued the ruling Monday. It gives Washington three months to bring
its laws into compliance with treaty agreements or face retaliatory tariffs.
Washington had repealed the offending law, but the WTO says a replacement law
is still unfair.
