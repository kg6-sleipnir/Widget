Spider-Man 3 spun a solid gold web in Asia, setting box-office records in
Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong.
The special effects-laden thriller took in an estimated $3.5 million in its
first day of Japanese release, while grossing $3.4 million in South Korea.
Both figures top opening day tallies for the first two entries in the series.
It also enjoyed the largest opening-day performance for any film in Hong Kong
and South Korean history.
