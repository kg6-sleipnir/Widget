In 1993, 14 imprisoned Buddhist nuns secretly recorded protest songs and
smuggled the tape out of Drapchi Prison in Tibet. When word of the recording
got out, the nuns say Chinese authorities added five to nine years to their
sentences.  Seven nuns eventually were released, but remain in Tibet.  One died
in custody and six others now live in exile. Four are currently visiting London
to help raise awareness of the Tibetan struggle for independence and religious
freedom.  Catherine Drew has more.
