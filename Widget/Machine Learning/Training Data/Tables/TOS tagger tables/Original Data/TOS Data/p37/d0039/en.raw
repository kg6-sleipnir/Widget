Colombia has extradited 13 alleged drug traffickers to stand trial in U.S.
courts in the states of Florida and New York.
 
Officials say the Colombian suspects were flown Wednesday to the United States,
where they have been charged with cocaine trafficking and money laundering.
 
Colombian authorities say they have extradited at least 63 drug suspects to the
United States this year.
 
In 1997, Colombia restored a law to extradite nationals charged with drug
offenses, which had been suspended amid a campaign of violence by Colombian
drug cartels.
