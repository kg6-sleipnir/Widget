Members of the Palestinian's Fatah party say they have agreed on a cabinet for
Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia after days of negotiations and delays.
Mr. Qureia has been trying all week to get a new cabinet approved in the
Palestinian parliament. The prime minister abandoned his original cabinet list
Monday after several legislators charged it had many corrupt officials, and
threatened to vote it down.
Palestinian officials say the vote is now rescheduled for Thursday. Mr. Qureia
must step down if he fails to get his cabinet approved.
