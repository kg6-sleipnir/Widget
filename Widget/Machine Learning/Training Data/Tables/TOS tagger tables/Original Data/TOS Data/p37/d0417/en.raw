Colombian police have deactivated two explosive devices found on a highway in
northern Bogota.
Authorities discovered the devices Saturday, following a tip from someone who
noticed a suspicious bag and suitcase lying by a street light. They say the
devices each contained three kilograms of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil, known
as anfo.
Police secured the area in order to deactivate the devices, triggering traffic
backups.
