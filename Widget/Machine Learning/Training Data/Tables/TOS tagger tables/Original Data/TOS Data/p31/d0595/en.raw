Algae blooms naturally in lakes, rivers and ponds, and in the ocean, often
along coastlines.   What scientists say they don't know is what triggers
massive blooms like the one seen recently in Qingdao, China - or why some
blooms are harmful or toxic while others are not.  To learn more about toxic
algae, we spent a day in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. State of Maryland with research
scientist Celia Dawson.  VOA's Paul Sisco reports.
