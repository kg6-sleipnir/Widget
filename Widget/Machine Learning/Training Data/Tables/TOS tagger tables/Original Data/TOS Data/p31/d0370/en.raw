Russian President Vladimir Putin has dissolved the government.
Russian officials and news reports say Mr. Putin dismissed the government
Wednesday after Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov offered his resignation.
The reports say Mr. Fradkov decided to urge Mr. Putin to dissolve the
government because of upcoming major political events, and a desire to give the
president the full freedom to make decisions about staff.
Russia is set to hold parliamentary elections in December. Presidential
elections are to be held three months after that.
