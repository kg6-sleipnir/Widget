Security sources say Palestinian forces loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas have
shut down four charities and two printing shops in the West Bank for their
alleged ties to rival political faction Hamas.

The stores and charities, located in an around the southern town of Hebron,
were closed Friday.

Sources say the printing shops were publishing material that could incite
violence against the government.

Mr. Abbas has recently intensified a crackdown on Hamas in the West Bank.

Last year, Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip after routing Fatah forces
loyal to the Palestinian president.
