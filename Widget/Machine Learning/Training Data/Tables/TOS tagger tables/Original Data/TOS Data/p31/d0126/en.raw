Pakistan's military says one soldier and seven militants were killed during a
gun battle in the northwestern Swat Valley.

An army statement Wednesday said forces were conducting a search operation in
Charai when the clash broke out. Two soldiers also were wounded.

The army says it has captured at least 23 suspected militants in the area.

Pakistan's government launched an offensive in late April aimed at clearing
militants from the greater Swat valley region.

The military says it has driven most of the Taliban from the valley, but
sporadic fighting persists.
