Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has banned smoking in a wide range of public
places.

Mr. Assad announced the ban Sunday, forbidding smoking in restaurants, cafes,
movie theaters, educational institutions and hospitals. Smoking will also be
banned on public transportation.

The measure includes the use of water pipes favored by locals and tourists
alike.

Violators of the ban face a fine of about $45.

Earlier this year, Syria issued a law forbidding the sale of tobacco to those
under 18 years of age.
