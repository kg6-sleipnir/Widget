Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz
Poland's parliamentary speaker WÅ‚odzimierz Cimoszewicz says he will run for
president in October's election, with recent opinion polls suggesting he could
win.
Mr. Cimoszewicz, of the ruling Democratic Left Alliance, has remained untouched
by a string of scandals that have tarnished his party. Polls have put him ahead
of other hopefuls, including leading conservative Lech Kaczynski.
Poland's President Alexander Kwasniewski cannot run for re-election because he
has already served two terms.
Opinion polls indicate Polish leftists will be defeated in parliamentary
elections, scheduled for September 25.
