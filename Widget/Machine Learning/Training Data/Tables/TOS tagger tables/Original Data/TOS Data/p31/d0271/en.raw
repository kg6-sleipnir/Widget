Police were also among the more than 11 people wounded in Wednesday's blast,
which happened in Quetta, the provincial capital. Â 

Baluchistan has long been the site of a low-level insurgency seeking more
autonomy for the province and a greater share of money from its natural
resources.

In recent weeks, the region has also seen several attacks on trucks carrying
supplies to NATO troops in Afghanistan.
