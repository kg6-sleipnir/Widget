NATO said  two U.S. soldiers have been killed in a bomb blast in southern
Afghanistan.

The NATO-led force released no other details of the incident.  The U.S.
military confirmed the soldiers were American.

July has been the deadliest month for international forces in Afghanistan since
the Taliban-led government was ousted in 2001.

In recent weeks, 4,000 U.S. Marines, along with British and Afghan troops, have
launched a major offensive in southern Afghanistan, targeting Taliban
insurgents in their traditional strongholds.  

The operation is aimed at ensuring security ahead of Afghanistan's presidential
election next month.
