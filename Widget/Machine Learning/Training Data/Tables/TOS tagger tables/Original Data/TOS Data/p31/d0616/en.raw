Afghan officials say two separate accidental explosions killed four children
and three police officers in the capital, Kabul, Monday.
In the first incident, authorities said a group of children was playing with an
old artillery shell when it exploded. The blast killed four of the children.
Afghanistan remains littered with unexploded munitions and landmines after
decades of war.
The second blast happened as a group of police officers was preparing for a
mission.
A spokesman for the Interior Ministry said one of the officers accidentally
dropped a rocket-propelled grenade.
The explosion killed three officers.
