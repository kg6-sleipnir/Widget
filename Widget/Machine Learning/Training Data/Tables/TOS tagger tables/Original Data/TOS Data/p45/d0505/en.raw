Palestinian sources say two police officers have been killed and several others
wounded in an explosion in the northern Gaza Strip that destroyed a building
used by Palestinian security forces.
A Palestinian Interior Ministry spokesman accused Israel in the incident at the
Jabaliya refugee camp. But the Israeli army said it was not involved.
Israel has recently stepped up air strikes and artillery shelling against
militant targets in northern Gaza, in response to ongoing rocket fire from Gaza
militants targeting southern Israel.
