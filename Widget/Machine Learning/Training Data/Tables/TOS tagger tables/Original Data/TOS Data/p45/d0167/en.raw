Burmese officials say they plan to release 5,000 prisoners to mark the 60th
anniversary of the country's independence on Tuesday.
Burma's military government issued the announcement on state-radio Sunday.
Since November, officials have freed some 20,000 prisoners, including some who
had been illegally jailed by the former National Intelligence Bureau.
The government has dismantled the organization led by disgraced Prime Minister
Khin Nyunt.
