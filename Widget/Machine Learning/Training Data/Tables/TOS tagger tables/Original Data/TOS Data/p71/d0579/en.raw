Afghan authorities say Taleban militants have freed a Lebanese engineer who was
kidnapped earlier this week.
Officials say Ahmed Reza was released near a police checkpoint in southern
Zabul province early Thursday.
Mr. Reza, who was working on a U.S.-funded road project, was abducted Sunday
night as he drove on the main highway linking the capital, Kabul, with the
southern city of Kandahar.
The abductors had threatened to kill Mr. Reza if the Turkish company he worked
for did not leave Afghanistan. But it was not clear if the demand had been met.
