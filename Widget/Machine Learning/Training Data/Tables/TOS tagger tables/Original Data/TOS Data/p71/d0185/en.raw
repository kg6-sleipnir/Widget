NATO says three American soldiers have been killed in two separate bomb attacks
in Afghanistan.

The alliance says two U.S. troops were killed in an explosion in eastern
Afghanistan Friday.Â  Another U.S. service member was killed the same day in a
bombing in the country's south.

This is already the deadliest year for international troops serving in
Afghanistan since the war began.

U.S. President Barack Obama is weighing a recommendation by his top commander
in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal to send more troops to battle a
growing Taliban insurgency.
