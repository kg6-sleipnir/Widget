Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has extended electricity rationing for another
60 days in hopes that seasonal rains will help refill the low water levels at
the country's hydroelectric dams.

President Chavez declared an electricity emergency in February in the oil-rich
nation, saying the country was facing the worst drought in a century.

The hydroelectric sector provides more than 60 percent of Venezuela's
electricity.  

Last month, Venezuelan officials announced a 24-hour electrical power cutoff
for 80 firms because they failed to reduce their power usage as directed in the
emergency decree.
