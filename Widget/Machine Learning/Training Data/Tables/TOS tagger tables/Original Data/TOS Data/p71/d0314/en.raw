South Africa will give survivors of the Asian tsunami a dozen large shipping
containers filled with smuggled clothes and shoes that have been confiscated by
customs officers.
The South African government said Wednesday it is donating the six meter-
longÂ containers to the South African Red Cross for distribution in countries
devastated by the tsunami. South Africa has already set up a national committee
to raise funds for those affected the disaster.
South African officials say the tsunami killed at least nine South African
tourists in Thailand. Hundreds more are listed as missing.
