Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says his government is taking over several
metal companies.
He announced Saturday Venezuela will nationalize businesses including Matesi,
which produces iron briquettes, and aluminum-maker Norpro.
Venezuela began to take over Matesi from its Luxembourg-based parent company
Tenaris last year. Mr. Chavez says he is moving to nationalize Matesi after
settlement talks failed.
There was no immediate comment from Tenaris or any of the companies listed for
nationalization.
In recent years, Mr. Chavez has nationalized firms in many sectors, including
petroleum, communications, electricity, banking and agriculture.
