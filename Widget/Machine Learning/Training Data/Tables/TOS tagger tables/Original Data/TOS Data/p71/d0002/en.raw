Police in Israel say they are deciding whether to press charges against two of
Leonardo DiCaprio's bodyguards.
The men last week scuffled with photographers, injuring three, as the actor
visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem.
The photographers claim the bodyguards attacked them as DiCaprio climbed into a
van, while the actor's publicist blames an overaggressive press corps.
Israeli police say they don't know when a decision to press charges will
appear.
