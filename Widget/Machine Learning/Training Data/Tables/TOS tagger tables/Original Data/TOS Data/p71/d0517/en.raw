State media in Zimbabwe say security forces briefly detained the U.S.
ambassador there this week for trespassing in a restricted area near a home of
President Robert Mugabe.
Ambassador Christopher Dell was reportedly detained for about 30 minutes Monday
after approaching a restricted security area in the National Botanical Gardens
near the president's official Harare residence.
There has been no official U.S. comment on the incident.
Relations between the United States and Zimbabwe have been strained in recent
years.
