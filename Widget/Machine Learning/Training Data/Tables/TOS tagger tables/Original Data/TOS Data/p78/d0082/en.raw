Doctors have developed a new device to measure cancer cells that break off from
lung tumors and travel through the blood. It can also determine when the cancer
cells become resistant to drug treatments. The technology was developed at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.  A clinical trial using the device
was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. VOA's Deborah Block has
more.
