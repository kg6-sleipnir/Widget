A strong earthquake has struck under the sea in eastern Indonesia, off of
Sulawesi Island. 
The U.S. Geological Survey says the 7.3 magnitude quake struck Sunday night,
about 165 kilometers east of the North Sulawesi provincial capital, Minado.
Witnesses in Minado said hundreds of people fled their homes, and the
foundations of some buildings were damaged.  There were no reports of injuries.
Shortly after the first quake reports, Indonesian authorities measured the
quake strength at 6.9 magnitude, and said it could pose a tsunami risk. 
However, no tsunami was reported.
