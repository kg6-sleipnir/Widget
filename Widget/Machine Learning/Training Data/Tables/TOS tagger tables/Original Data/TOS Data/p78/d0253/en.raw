Israel's cabinet has approved the release of five Palestinian prisoners as the
final step of a prisoner exchange with Lebanon's Hezbollah militia.

Israeli officials say none of the prisoners were involved in deadly attacks
against Israel.

The release of the Palestinians comes as part of an agreement last month in
which Israel freed five Lebanese prisoners and returned the remains of nearly
200 Arab fighters in exchange for the bodies of two Israeli soldiers.

The two soldiers were captured by Hezbollah in a raid that triggered the 2006
Lebanon war.
