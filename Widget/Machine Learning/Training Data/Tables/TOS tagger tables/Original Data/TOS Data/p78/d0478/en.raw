Officials in Colombia say Marxist rebels killed the mayor of the small central
town of Genova Wednesday.
Police say Mayor Jose Castro was shot by members of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group.
The FARC rebels have declared Colombian mayors to be military targets and
killed at least three in the past year.
The rebel group has been waging war against the Colombian government for at
least 40 years and funds itself largely through the drug trade and kidnapping.
