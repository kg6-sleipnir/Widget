Iraqi police say gunmen killed four people in a raid on jewelry shops in the
central city of Fallujah, Saturday.

The French news agency, AFP, says the robbers escaped with thousands of dollars
in precious metals.

Brazen daytime robberies are regularly reported in Iraq, where security
conditions remain unstable.

Meanwhile, police say a roadside bomb killed one police officer and wounded
five others in the northern city of Mosul, Saturday.

Investigators say the bomb exploded near a police patrol.
