Two members of the NATO-led coalition in Afghanistan have been killed in a
helicopter crash in the southern part of the country. Â 

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the downing of the helicopter near
Lashkar Gah in Helmand province.

NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said the incident is
under investigation and has not ruled out the possibility of hostile fire.

There was no immediate word on the nationality of the two service members on
board the helicopter.
