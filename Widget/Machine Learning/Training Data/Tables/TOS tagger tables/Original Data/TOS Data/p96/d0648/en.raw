The World Health Organization says manufacturers will be able to produce only
about 3 billion doses of H1N1 swine flu vaccine this year, instead of the
earlier predicted 5 billion.

The organization says a single dose of the vaccine will be sufficient for
healthy adults and older children, but will be inadequate to cover the world's
6.8 billion people.

The United Nations health agency says Australia, China, Hungary and the United
States have already licensed vaccines for the pandemic strain of the illness.Â 
Japan and several countries in Europe will follow shortly.
