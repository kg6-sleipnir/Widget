Turkish officials say a roadside bomb has killed at least eight soldiers in
eastern Turkey.

Three soldiers were wounded in Monday's attack.

Officials say the landmine went off as a military vehicle was traveling on a
remote road in eastern Erzincan province.

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.

Militants form the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) often attack
security forces with remote-controlled explosives.

The PKK has been fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since
1984.Â  The violence has killed more than 30,000 people.
