Salvadoran lawmakers have approved the extension of their country's military
mission in Iraq.
They voted late Thursday to keep soldiers in the war-torn country for
humanitarian and reconstruction work for another year.
El Salvador is the last Latin American country with military forces in Iraq.
Honduras, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic have withdrawn their troops.
El Salvador sent its first group of more than 350 soldiers to Iraq in August
2003.
