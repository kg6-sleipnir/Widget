French officials say rioters burned cars and shot at police while protesting
the police shooting of a man accused of robbing a casino.

The riot erupted late Friday night in the southeastern city of Grenoble.

Officials said the rioters also torched shops and attacked a streetcar
(tramway) line.Â  Police said some rioters also shot at officers and that they
returned fire.

The French newspaper Le Monde says the youths started their rampage after
hearing a Muslim imam give a ceremony for an alleged robber, who died Thursday
night after being chased by police and exchanging gunfire.
