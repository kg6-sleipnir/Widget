Kyrgyzstan's old parliament has formally agreed to step down, deferring to
newly elected deputies in an effort to reduce political tensions in the central
Asian country.
The move to disband came after the new parliament confirmed opposition leader
Kurmanbek Bakiyev as prime minister and appointed him acting president.
The development Monday angered opposition protesters who said the new
parliament was chosen in rigged elections. Mass protests over the disputed
balloting brought down the previous government and led to the ouster of
President Askar Akayev.
Kyrgyz lawmakers have set June 26 for new presidential elections.
