Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki has declared the food shortages ravaging the
country a national disaster.
Mr. Kibaki made the announcement Sunday during a New Year's Day speech. He says
nearly 2.5 million people will need food aid, which he estimates will cost more
than $150 million.
At least 20 people and thousands of livestock have died as a result of a
drought and famine.
Officials say thousands of prisoners planned to skip their annual New Year's
lunch so the food could go to those affected by the famine.
