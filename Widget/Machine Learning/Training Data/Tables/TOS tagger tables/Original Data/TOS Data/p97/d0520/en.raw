Wheat futures shot up this week to near the all-time high ($11.6975 a bushel)
as foreign buyers scrambled to lock in supplies. A combination of bad weather,

growing demand for biofuel crops such as corn means farmers are planting less
wheat. For consumers it is a recipe for higher food prices. VOA's Mil Arcega
