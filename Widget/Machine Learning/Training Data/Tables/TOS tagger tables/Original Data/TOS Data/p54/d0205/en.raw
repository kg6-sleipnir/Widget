 Crude oil prices fell after some downbeat economic reports pointed to a deeper
recession in the United States, which would push energy demand down.

Traders also expect a U.S. government report to show continued growth of oil
inventories in the world's biggest energy market.

The price of a barrel of oil for future delivery fell more than $4 to hit
$41.67 at the close of trading in New York.

Oil has fallen as low as $33 a barrel recently, and hit an all-time high above
$147 a barrel last July.Â
