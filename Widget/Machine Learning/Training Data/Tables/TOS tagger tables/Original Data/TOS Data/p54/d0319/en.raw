The International Olympic Committee says a Ukrainian heptathlon silver medalist
is under investigation for a positive drug test at the Beijing Olympics.

The IOC said Wednesday it has opened a probe into Lyudmila Blonska, who
finished second behind Ukrainian Natalia Dobrynska last Saturday.

The IOC's disciplinary commission and executive board are expected to rule on
the case Thursday.  If found guilty, Blonska would be stripped of her medal and
could be subjected to a lifetime ban.

Blonska served a separate doping suspension earlier this decade.
