The Iraqi government has ordered the pan-Arab satellite network Al-Arabiya to
close its bureau in Baghdad for one month.
Iraqi officials are quoted as saying the ban is because of what they have
described as the network's uneven reporting and unprofessional conduct in
covering events in Iraq.Â 
Dubai-based Al-Arabiya was briefly banned in November 2003 after airing an
audiotape from Saddam Hussein.
The U.S.-backed interim Iraqi government banned the Arabic satellite network
Al-Jazeera in 2004 for allegedly inciting violence.
