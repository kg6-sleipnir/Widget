Spain's top anti-terrorism judge has indicted eight Islamic militants for
allegedly helping a suspected mastermind of the September 11 attacks on the
United States.
Judge Baltasar Garzon Monday formally charged the eight with providing fake
identity papers and other documents to Ramzi Binalshibh.
He is in U.S. custody, suspected of being the contact between al-Qaida and the
September 11 hijackers.
One of the suspects charged Monday - Tahar Ezirouali - is still at large and
was indicted in absentia.
