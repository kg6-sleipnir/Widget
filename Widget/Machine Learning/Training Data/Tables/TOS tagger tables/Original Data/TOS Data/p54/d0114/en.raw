Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says he plans to raise taxes on foreign oil
companies in Venezuela.
Mr. Chavez Sunday described the move as a "tax on extraction," saying it would
create one billion dollars in new state revenue.
He made the announcement Sunday during his weekly television and radio program.
The new tax will be 33 percent - up from 16.7 percent.
Mr. Chavez has accused foreign oil companies of exploiting his country's vast
petroleum reserves without paying sufficient taxes, and has taken steps to
increase revenue from the industry.
