Tidal waves caused by the massive Asian earthquake have killed at least 10
people on Africa's east coast with a number of other tourists and residents
reported missing.
Authorities from Somalia to South Africa and the Indian Ocean islands have
urged people to move inland.
At least one death is reported in Kenya while the Associated Press reports nine
drowned in Somalia.
High waves have also smashed a number of fishing boats and left parts of the
island of Rodrigues under water.
