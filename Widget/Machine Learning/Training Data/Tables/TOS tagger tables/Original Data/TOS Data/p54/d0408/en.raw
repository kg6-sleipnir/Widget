 U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan say they killed 15 militants during an
overnight operation in the east, while local officials says those killed were
civilians.

In a statement Saturday, coalition forces say their troops were targeting
Taliban militants in Laghman province when they came under attack.  It says the
troops returned fire, killing 15 militants, including a woman carrying a
rocket-propelled grenade.

Local officials dispute the account and say as many as 22 civilians were
killed.
