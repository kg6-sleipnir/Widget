Japan and North Korea say they are considering a resumption of bilateral talks
as part of efforts to normalize relations.
Japanese media reported Monday that the two countries hope to arrange to hold
the talks in Beijing in early November. The talks could come before six-party
talks on North Korea's nuclear ambitions resume.
Japan and North Korea have not had formal bilateral talks for about a year.
Tokyo and Pyongyang are at odds over North Korea's nuclear weapons program and
the North's kidnapping of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s.
