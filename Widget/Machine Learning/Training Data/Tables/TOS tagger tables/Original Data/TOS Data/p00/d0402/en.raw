Police in Japan say a teacher stabbed to death a 12-year-old girl Saturday in
the country's third killing of a school girl in less than three weeks.
Yu Hagino, 23,Â was arrested at the murder scene, a school in the western city
of Uji.
Police say the suspect confessed to stabbing the girl with a knife after
arguing with her.
The killing follows the recent murders of two school girls in the space of just
over a week. The two were killed in separate incidents as they walked home
alone from elementary school along deserted roads.
