China's giant pandas have been on endangered species lists for nearly 30 years.
There are only about 1,600 pandas still living in the wild in China. One of the
2008 Olympic mascots is modeled on a panda called Jing Jing. Conservationists
hope she will help draw attention to the threats facing the giant panda -- one
of China's national symbols. Sam Beattie reports from Jing Jing's home in
Sichuan province.
