Latvia's President Vaira Vike-Freiberga
Latvia's parliament has extended the stay of the country's troops serving in
Iraq until the end of the year.
Sixty seven of the 100 lawmakers Thursday in Riga voted in favor of extending
the mission by six months.
Latvia, which joined NATO last year, has more than 100 troops in Iraq
supporting the U.S efforts there. Latvia has also contributed troops to
multinational forces in Afghanistan and the Balkans.
