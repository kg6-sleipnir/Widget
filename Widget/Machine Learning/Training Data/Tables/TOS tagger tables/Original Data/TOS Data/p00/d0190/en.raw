U.S. automaker Chrysler has opened a $570 million engine plant in northern
Mexico.

During the ceremonial startup of the Saltillo plant Friday, Mexican President
Felipe Calderon said Chrysler's sixth plant in Mexico will create 700 jobs.

Mr. Calderon said Mexico has become a worldwide leader in the auto industry.

Chrysler plans to build its new fuel-efficient Pentastar V-6 engine for
Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram vehicles.

Mexican officials say the new plant will have the capacity to build 440,000
engines per year.
