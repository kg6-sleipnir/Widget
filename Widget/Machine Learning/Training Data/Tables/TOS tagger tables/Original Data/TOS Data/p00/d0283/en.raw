Kyrgyzstan's Justice Ministry says four people, including parliament member
Tynychbek Akmatbayev, have been killed at a prison near Bishkek after inmates
took them hostage.
Interior Minister Murat Sutalinov is at the prison to head negotiations with
the inmates. The ministry gave no other details.
It is not clear if the hostage-takers made any demands.
Mr. Akmatbayev was involved in negotiations on Wednesday at another Kyrgyz
prison where a riot over poor living conditions forced the staff to evacuate
earlier this week.
That prison, also near Bishkek, remained surrounded by security forces on
Thursday.
