Afghan officials say four Taleban guerrillas were killed when the bomb they
were planting on a road went off prematurely.
The incident took place on Saturday night in restive Kandahar province in the
south.
Local officials say the insurgents' bodies were blown to pieces.
Taleban fighters have used roadside bombs against U.S. and Afghan government
troops, especially in the south and east of the country.
Nearly 60 U.S. soldiers and scores of Afghan troops have been killed in the
Taleban insurgency this year, the bloodiest period since 2001 when U.S.-led
troops ousted Taleban rulers.
