President Bush will travel to Europe in February for talks with NATO and
European Union officials as he starts his second term in office.
A White House spokesman says the visit February 22 will include talks with
Alliance heads of state, top European Commission officials and Belgian Prime
Minister Guy Verhofstadt.
The spokesman called the trip an effort to strengthen cooperation in the
struggle against terrorism.
In Brussels Secretary of State Colin Powell said the February trip is an
attempt to rebuild ties strained by disagreements over the U.S.-led war in
Iraq.
