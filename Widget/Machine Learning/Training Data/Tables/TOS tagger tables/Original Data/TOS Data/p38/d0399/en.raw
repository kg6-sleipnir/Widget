Every two years, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City mounts an
exhibition of new art made in the U.S. The show aims to survey contemporary
art's newest trends and methods. Not surprisingly, given its influence on young
artists and art markets, the result is often controversial. Some have taken to
calling it the show that people love to hate. The Whitney's 2008 Biennial, its
74th, continues that tradition. VOA's Carolyn Weaver reports.
