Unidentified gunmen have fired on a car carrying a Czech diplomat in
Afghanistan, injuring his two bodyguards.
Filip Velach, the Czech charge d'affaires, was not hurt in the attack which
took place about 100 kilometers outside the capital, Kabul.
The three sought safety in a house and were later rescued by NATO's
International Security Assistance Force.
Last month, the Czech Republic opened a diplomatic office in Kabul, headed by
Velach. More than 150 Czech troops are currently serving in Afghanistan.
