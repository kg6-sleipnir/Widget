Turkish police have detained 23 people suspected of having links with the al-
Qaida terrorist network.
Police detained the suspects Wednesday in the northwestern province of Bursa.
In May, police detained 11 suspected al-Qaida militants who were believed to be
planning terrorist attacks in Istanbul.
A Turkish al-Qaida cell was blamed in four suicide bombings in 2003 that killed
at least 58 people and injured hundreds more. Those attacks targeted two
synagogues, the British consulate and a London-based bank.
