Two NATO soldiers have died in an explosion in southern Afghanistan.

NATO's International Security Assistance Force released a statement Wednesday
saying the soldiers were killed by an improvised explosive device.  Officials
did not disclose the soldiers' nationalities.

Separately, NATO says coalition forces captured a Taliban sub-commander late
Tuesday while searching a compound in Nangarhar province, east of Kabul.  An
ISAF statement says the unidentified sub-commander was involved in kidnappings,
weapons purchases and spying on coalition forces.   

ISAF also says allied forces captured several other suspected militants in
Helmand province late Tuesday.
