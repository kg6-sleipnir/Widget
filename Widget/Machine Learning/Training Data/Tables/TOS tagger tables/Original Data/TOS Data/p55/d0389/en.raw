Police in Istanbul, Turkey have arrested four men suspected of having links to
al-Qaida.
Police say they made the arrests in a low income area of the city and found
small arms and documents on bomb-making in the men's homes.
Police say the men may have been planning bomb attacks.
Security sources say the men were first spotted chanting slogans and hanging
banners in support of al-Qaida in Iraq chief Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, shortly
after U.S. forces killed him in June.Â
