Philippine communist guerrillas say they will not observe the usual Christmas
ceasefire with the government.
Spokesman Gregorio Rosal for two communist groups (the New People's Army and
the Communist Party of the Philippines) said Thursday there is no point in a
truce, and accused government forces of murdering allied leftists.
The Philippine military had recommended a unilateral ceasefire for Christmas
Day (December 25) and New Year's Day, pending approval by President Gloria
Arroyo.
The government and communist rebels have been engaged in armed conflict for
more than 40 years.
