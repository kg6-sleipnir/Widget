NATO officials say alliance troops Friday raided the home of Mladjen Kenjic, a
suspected backer of fugitive wartime Bosnian Serb military commander General
Ratko Mladic.
A NATO spokesman says troops searched his home in the village of Vojkovici,
just outside Sarajevo. News reports identify Mr. Kenjic as a former member of
General Mladic's personal security team.
The Hague tribunal indicted General Mladic on genocide and other charges for
attacks against civilians during the 1990's conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
