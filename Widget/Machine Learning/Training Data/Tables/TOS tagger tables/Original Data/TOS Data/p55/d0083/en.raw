Hobart Boulevard Elementary School is located in a poor Los Angeles
neighborhood, infested with gangs and drugs. Yet in a fifth grade classroom,
children of immigrants, many who speak English as a second language, are
learning important life lessons thanks to one teacher and the works of William
Shakespeare.
VOA's Yi Suli introduces us to a group of young thespians who are known around
the world as the "Hobart Shakespeareans."
