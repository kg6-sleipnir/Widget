French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has successfully undergone gall
bladder surgery.
Defense ministry officials say the surgery Saturday went well and they indicate
that Mr. Raffarin will remain in the hospital for several days.
Earlier Saturday, Mr. Raffarin abruptly canceled plans to travel to World War
II anniversary ceremonies in the city of Reims. Instead, he entered the Paris
Val De Grace military hospital.
The 56-year-old Mr. Raffarin assumed the post of prime minister three years
ago.
