Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and his Venezuelan counterpart,
Hugo Chavez, have signed a series of agreements in what they called a strategic
alliance.
The two presidents met Monday in Caracas. They signed accords on cooperation in
the areas of oil, construction, science and the military.
The Associated Press quotes President Chavez as saying the meeting was a
critical development for the countries' integration.
During their meeting, the leaders were also to discuss the selling of Brazilian
aircraft to Venezuela's military.
