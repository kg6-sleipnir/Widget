At least 16 people were killed and an unknown number are still trapped in a
residential building that collapsed in Lagos, Nigerla late Tuesday.
The four-story apartment building collapsed in the evening after many occupants
had returned home from work.
Rescuers saved at least 36 people from the rubble, many of them injured.
The Associated Press says authorities are blaming poor construction as the
likely cause of the collapse.
Poor construction has been blamed for previous collapses in Lagos, including
the fall of an 18-story building
in March that killed two people and injured 24.
