The music of jazz musician Miles Davis remains popular more than 16 years after
his death. His music is being sampled by hip-hop artists, actor Don Cheadle is
set to portray him in a movie and a new CD has been released with remixed and
updated versions of his music. VOA Persian Service's Benham Natagehi sat down
with Davis' son Erin to discuss his father's music. Ruth Reader narrates.
