Two roadside bombings in the Iraqi capital Tuesday killed four people and
wounded at least 15 others.

Iraqi officials say the attacks were aimed at police patrols in Baghdad.

Authorities say in one case, a roadside bomb exploded near a hospital in
central Baghdad, killing a police officer and a civilian.

The second roadside attack happened in western Baghdad, killing two people.
