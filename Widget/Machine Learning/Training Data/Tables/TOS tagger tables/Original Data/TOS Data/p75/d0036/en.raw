Seven years ago, the U.S. was struck by the most devastating terrorist attack
in its history. The news media responded to the events of September 11, 2001,
providing live coverage as events unfolded in a tireless and sometimes heroic
fashion. That reporting is on display in a special gallery at Washington's
Newseum, a museum dedicated to journalism. VOA's Tabinda Naeem has more on the
exhibit depicting many of the challenges faced that day by the media.  Jim
Bertel narrates.
