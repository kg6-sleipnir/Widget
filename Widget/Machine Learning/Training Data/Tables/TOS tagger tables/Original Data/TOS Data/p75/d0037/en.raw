Iraqi police say a double-bombing Wednesday in central Baghdad has killed at
least six people and wounded at least 41 others.

Police say a car bomb went off near a traffic police station a few kilometers
from where British Prime Minister Gordon Brown met with Iraqi officials.Â 
Moments later, a second bomb exploded nearby.

On Monday, Iraqi police said a bomb killed at least eight policemen at a
checkpoint west of Baghdad.
