Afghan officials say fierce fighting has erupted between government security
forces and Taleban rebels a day after U.S. airstrikes killed as many as 20
suspected militants in southern Afghanistan.
Gunbattles early Monday have left 11 Taleban guerillas dead, along with a local
government official and a member of Afghanistan's security force.
On Sunday, the U.S. military said it had killed 15 to 20 suspected Taleban
fighters in an airstrike after coalition forces came under small arms and
rocket fire.
Violence in the south and east regions of Afghanistan has increased in the last
three months.
