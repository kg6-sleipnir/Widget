A privately-owned Kuwaiti airline is offering free flights to Kuwaiti women who
want to return home to vote in parliamentary elections.
The elections are the first in Kuwait that do not exclude women.
Marwan Boodai, the chairman of Jazeera Airways says the airline wants to make
sure that Kuwaiti women currently overseas can exercise their new right to
vote. Elections are scheduled for June 29.
Kuwait passed a law last year granting women the right to vote and run for
office.
