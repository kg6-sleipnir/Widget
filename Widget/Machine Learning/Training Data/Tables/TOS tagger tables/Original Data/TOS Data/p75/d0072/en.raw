A security scare rippled through the embassies of Japan, Thailand and Germany
in Malaysia Tuesday after what police called suspicious packages were received
at the facilities.
Officials in Kuala Lumpur say Japan's embassy was evacuated after receiving a
package containing a liquid substance. Kuala Lumpur Police Chief Mustafa
Abdullah said the liquid appeared to be a harmless oil. The embassy has since
been given the all clear.
Mr. Mustafa said similar packages were sent to the Thai and German embassies.
It is not immediately clear if the packages were part of a hoax.
