The International Olympic Committee says it has "full confidence" that London
will be able to provide a secure environment when it hosts the 2012 Olympic
games.
A spokeswoman for the Olympic committee made the comment just hours after a
series of terrorist attacks shook London Thursday.
On Wednesday, the IOC selected the British capital to host the 2012 games
during a meeting in Singapore. London beat out Paris, Madrid, New York and
Moscow.
The British Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell said plans to celebrate the
homecoming of the British Olympic delegation have been canceled.
