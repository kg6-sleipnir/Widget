Malaysian officials say they have detained 93 ethnic Rohingya Muslims who fled
Burma.

The officials say they seized a boat containing the men earlier this week.

Thai officials say their navy gave the men food and water when they entered
Thai water.

Thailand has admitted to chasing off refugee boats in the past, but say that
was not the case this time.
 
Burma's military government does not recognize ethnic Rohingya as citizens. 
More than 200,000 have fled Burmese state persecution to live in neighboring
Bangladesh.
