U.S. President Barack Obama is to host his French counterpart at the White
House next week for talks on a broad range of foreign policy and security
issues.

The White House says President Obama looks forward to working with President
Nicolas Sarkozy to sustain the global economic recovery and create jobs, as
France assumes the presidency of the Group of Eight and Group of 20 top
industrialized countries for 2011.
