Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas says he will ask the Palestinian Authority's
current prime minister, Ahmed Qureia, to stay on to form a new government.
Addressing his supporters in Ramallah Saturday after he was sworn into office,
Mr. Abbas expressed confidence in the prime minister and said they would
consult together on forming a new government.
Mr. Qureia became prime minister after Mr. Abbas resigned in September 2003, in
a dispute with Yasser Arafat.
