A Russian court has approved the extradition to Colombia of a former Israeli
army officer convicted in absentia of training Colombian rightist
paramilitaries.
Yair Klein was sentenced to 10 years in prison in Colombia. He was detained at
a Moscow airport in August last year.
A court spokesman says Klein has 10 days to appeal the ruling, which was made
Tuesday.
Colombia's paramilitary groups were organized in the 1980s as private armies
for landlords to protect them from leftist guerrillas.
