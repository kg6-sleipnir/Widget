Afghan police say suspected Taleban fighters have killed five police officers
in an ambush in southern Afghanistan.
Authorities said Wednesday, the attacks occurred late Tuesday in Helmand
province.
The incident comes one day after Afghan police killed two suspected Taleban
fighters, including a Taleban commander, during a gunbattle in the same
province. Twelve other fighters were arrested.
Helmand province has been the scene of several clashes in recent weeks. In late
October, at least eight Afghan police were killed in an ambush there.
