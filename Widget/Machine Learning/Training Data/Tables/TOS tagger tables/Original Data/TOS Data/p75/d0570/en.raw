Pakistani police say a suicide bomber blew himself up in the country's volatile
northwestern region, killing a child and wounding four other people.

Authorities say the attack happened Tuesday in the Swat Valley, near the border
with Afghanistan.  Suicide bombings in the region have killed at least 10
people in the last week.

The Pakistani government has been trying to regain control of the Swat Valley
in recent months, after militants regrouped there from other Pakistani border
areas with Afghanistan.
