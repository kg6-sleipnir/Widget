A Ugandan official says a massive landslide in eastern Uganda has killed at
least 106 people.

Minister of State for Disasters Mussa Ecweru told VOA's Swahili service that
300 people remain missing.

The landslide engulfed three villages in the Bududa region near Mount Elgon
late on Monday, following more than a week of heavy rain in the area.

Police and armed forces are taking part in efforts to find survivors.

Officials say the mudslide destroyed homes, markets, schools, and a health
clinic.
