An African Union official says two of the mission's peacekeepers have been
killed in an ambush in Sudan's volatile Darfur region.
The acting head of the AU mission in Sudan, Jean-Baptiste Natama, said the two
peacekeeping soldiers, as well as two civilian contractors, were killed
Saturday during a surprise attack in South Darfur.
More than 6,000 African Union peacekeepers are deployed to the region.
Fighting between Sudanese rebels and government-backed Arab militia in Darfur
has killed tens of thousands of people and driven more than two million others
from their homes since 2003.
