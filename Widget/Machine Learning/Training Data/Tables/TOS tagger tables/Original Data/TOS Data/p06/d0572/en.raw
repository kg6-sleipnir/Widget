Brazilian police say they have broken up a smuggling network, involving foreign
diplomats from at least five embassies.
Police say the foreign envoys used their diplomatic privileges help smuggle
items into the country tax free. The luxury products such as whiskey and
perfumes were sold to the upper class in the capital of Brasilia.
Federal police said Friday that embassies from three African and two Middle
Eastern countries were allegedly part of the ring.
