Afghan police say a suicide bomber has killed at least three people in the
south of the country.

Local police chief Jawid Ahmad said the bomber was also killed Saturday when he
detonated his explosives while riding his motorcycle in the border town of Spin
Boldak in Kandahar province.

Eight people, including women and children, were wounded in the attack.

Spin Boldak is a major crossing point between Afghanistan and Pakistan.Â 
Wednesday, a suicide bomber killed at least five security guards escorting a
NATO convoy in a similar attack in the area.
