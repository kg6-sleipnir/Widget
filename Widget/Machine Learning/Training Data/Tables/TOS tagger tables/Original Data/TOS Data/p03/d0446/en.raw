Greek officials say a moderate earthquake has struck off the coast of some of
the country's islands in the Aegean Sea.

The Athens Geodynamic Institute says Friday's magnitude 5.1 quake was centered
near the eastern islands of Kos and Astypaleia, about 300 kilometers from the
Greek capital.

There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
