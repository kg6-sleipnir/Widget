An Israeli airstrike has killed a Palestinian man in the Gaza Strip, east of
Gaza City.
The Israeli military says aircraft fired at three Palestinian gunmen who were
within meters of the security fence separating the Gaza Strip from Israel.
Palestinians give a different account. A Palestinian militant group, the
Popular Resistance Committees, says a bystander was killed when an Israeli
helicopter fired at a car carrying several of its fighters.
The violence comes three days before Palestinian parliamentary elections.
