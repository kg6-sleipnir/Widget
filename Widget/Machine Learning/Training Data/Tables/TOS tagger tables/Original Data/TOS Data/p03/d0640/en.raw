The leader of Germany's Social Democratic Party says he will not run again for
that post and might not serve in a new cabinet.
Franz Muentefering spoke Monday after the Social Democrats' executive committee
named a left-wing party member to run for party general secretary, rejecting
Mr. Muentefering's chosen candidate. The committee nominated Andrea Nahles to
run, rejecting Kajo Wasserhoevel.
Mr. Muentefering was set to become vice chancellor in a government led by
Christian Democrat Chancellor-designate Angela Merkel.
The Social Democrats will elect their general secretary in mid-November.
