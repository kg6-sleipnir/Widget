Russian Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov says Russia will soon begin testing a
new intercontinental ballistic missile system.
The Russian minister told reporters his country would develop weapons based on
the Topol-M mobile missiles and the sea-based Bulava system.
The Interfax news agency quotes Mr. Ivanov as saying Moscow plans to produce
nuclear weapons that can penetrate any defense system.
