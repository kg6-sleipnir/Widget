The Italian Foreign Ministry says a group of tourists, including 21 Italians,
have been found in southeastern Niger a day after an attack by bandits.
Details of the incident are sketchy, but the ministry said in a statement
Tuesday that the tourists may have been kidnapped in Niger near the border with
Chad on Monday.
It added that the group may have been held for a ransom demand.
Earlier, the ministry said it was sending a diplomat to Niger from its mission
in Ivory Coast in an effort to resolve the situation.
