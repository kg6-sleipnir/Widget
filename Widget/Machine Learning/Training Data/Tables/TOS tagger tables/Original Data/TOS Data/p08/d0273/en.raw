An influential Iranian cleric is calling on Muslim nations to help Lebanon's
Hezbollah guerrillas in their fight against Israel.
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, who heads the powerful Guardian Council, told the
Iranian Students News Agency Tuesday that he wants Muslims worldwide to provide
arms for Hezbollah, as well political and financial support for the militants.
Israel, the United States and allied Western states accuse Syria and Iran of
supporting Hezbollah with arms and cash. Iran says it provides only moral and
diplomatic support for the Shi'ite Islamic group.
