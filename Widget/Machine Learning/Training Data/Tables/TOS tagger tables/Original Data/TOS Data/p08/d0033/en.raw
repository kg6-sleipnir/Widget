Bulgaria has extradited the nephew of former Turkish president Suleyman Demirel
to Turkey, where he is wanted for massive fraud.
Yahya Murat Demirel and his wife, Aysegul Esenler, were arrested in the Black
Sea port city of Bourgas on December 31 when they tried to enter Bulgaria
illegally.
Mr. Demirel had been forbidden by Turkish courts to leave the country, where he
is on trial in connection with the collapse of Turkish Egebank, which he owned.
He and his wife were delivered to Turkish authorities Friday morning.
