Israeli doctors say the condition of former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has
deteriorated more than six months after he fell into a coma.
A spokesman for the hospital treating Mr. Sharon says over the past two days,
doctors have identified a deterioration in his kidney function and changes in
brain tissue.
The hospital in Tel Aviv says doctors are carrying out more tests to determine
the appropriate treatment for Mr. Sharon.
He went into the coma after suffering a massive brain hemorrhage January 4.
