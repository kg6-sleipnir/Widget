Pakistani officials say a U.S. missile strike in Pakistan's tribal region
Saturday killed two suspected militants.

Security officials said the strike targeted a house in the town of Mir Ali in
North Waziristan.

The region is considered a base for Taliban and al-Qaida insurgents accused of
attacking NATO troops across the border in Afghanistan.

U.S. President Barack Obama has increased the use of drone strikes to target
hideouts in Pakistan, causing friction between Washington and Islamabad.

Pakistan's government has objected to the attacks, saying they violate its
sovereignty.
