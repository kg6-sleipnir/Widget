German officials say the German woman who was taken hostage in Iraq last month
has been freed and appears to be in good health.
Germany's foreign minister (Frank-Walter Steinmeier) says archaeologist Susanne
Osthoff is now in the German embassy in Baghdad.
He gave no information on her release, saying only that she is no longer in the
hands of the kidnappers.
Ms. Osthoff and her driver disappeared on November 25 in the Nineveh region of
northwest Iraq.  She had been working in Iraq more than ten years.
