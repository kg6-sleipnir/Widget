United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan calls Iraqi voters courageous, and
says the world must support them. 
Speaking in Nigeria, Mr. Annan described Sunday's election as the first step in
a democratic process in Iraq.  He said Iraqis know they are voting for their
country's future and for the day "when they will take their destiny in their
own hands."
The secretary-general also appealed for an end to election-day violence.
