Pope John Paul has called for better integration among peoples as the Roman
Catholic Church marks the World Day of Migrants and Refugees.
In remarks at the Vatican Sunday, the pontiff said better integration among
peoples requires a fair balance between the affirmation of one's own identity
and recognition of that of others.
The 84-year-old pope greeted all migrants and said he wishes that sympathy and
understanding among cultures can grow through dialogue.
