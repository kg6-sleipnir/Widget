The U.S. military says it has released more than 11,000 Iraqis from military
detention centers this year.

In a statement issued Saturday coalition forces said the prisoners who were
once considered a security threat, have completed their detainment and can go
on to lead productive lives.

American military spokesman Major Neal Fisher says less than one percent of
those released have been detained again.

He also said at the current rate, the U.S. military expects to reach its goal
of having released more than 12,000 detainees by mid-September.
