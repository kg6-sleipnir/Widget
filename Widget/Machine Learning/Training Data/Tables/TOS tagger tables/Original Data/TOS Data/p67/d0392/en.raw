A new museum opened Friday in Washington on crime and law enforcement, mostly
in the United States. The museum is owned and financed by an entrepreneur and
it charges a fee for entry. Visitors are invited to pick up a rifle in a Wild
West shootout, plan a prison break and test their knowledge of infamous
murderers. VOA's Deborah Block was there.
