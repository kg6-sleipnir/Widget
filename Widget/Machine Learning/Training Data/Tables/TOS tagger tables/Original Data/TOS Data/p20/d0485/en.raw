Reuters news agency says the group led by Jordanian terrorist leader Abu Musab
al-Zarqawi claimed responsibility for the killing.
Guerrillas loyal to Zaraqawi's group also took responsibility for some of the
attacks Monday in Iraq that left 25 people dead.

Iraqi police and soldiers in Baquba killed 10 people.
