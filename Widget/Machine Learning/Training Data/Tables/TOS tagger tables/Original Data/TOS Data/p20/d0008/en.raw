Iraqi officials say a car bomb targeting a police patrol has killed six people
and wounded at least 11 more in a city north of Baghdad.

Police said Thursday the blast took place in central Tikrit, hometown of former
dictator Saddam Hussein.  They said four police officers were among the dead
and several others were wounded.  

Overall violence in Iraq has yet to match the peak reached in 2006 and 2007. 
However, insurgents have intensified attacks since inconclusive March elections
left the country without a governing coalition.
