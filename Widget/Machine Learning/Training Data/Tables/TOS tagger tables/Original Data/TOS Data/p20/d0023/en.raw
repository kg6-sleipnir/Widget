Sylvester Stallone faces stiff fines in Australia, where he is accused of
importing a muscle-building hormone.
The movie star was detained Feb. 16 in the Sydney airport, while authorities
searched his hotel room. He and his group subsequently left the country, and he
was not compelled to attend the March 13 hearing.
He is accused of possessing human growth hormone, classified in Australia as a
restricted performance-enhancing drug. The maximum penalty for illegal
possession is a fine of $86,000 and five years in prison.
Stallone is unlikely to face such a sentence.
