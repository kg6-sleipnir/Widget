Japan's parliament has ratified a free trade agreement with Mexico.
The accord, which was signed last September by Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi and Mexican President Vicente Fox, must still be ratified by
Mexico's legislature.
The trade accord promises to widen Japanese export opportunities in Mexico and
the United States, and aims to reduce Mexican dependence on the United States
for export sales.
About 90 percent of Mexico's exports go to the United States.
