For more than 20 years, researchers have gone hunting with sharks and stalking
prey with tigers from in front of their television monitors. National
Geographic researchers have an 'animal eye view' of the world through a video
camera built to be attached to living things. "Crittercam," as they call it,
has been mounted to animals of over 40 different species. Its creator recently
sat down with VOA's Paul Sisco.
