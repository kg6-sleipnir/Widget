Afghan authorities have ordered the slaughter of birds in areas where two cases
of bird flu have been found.
The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization said Wednesday birds carrying the
virus have been reported in the eastern provinces of Nangarhar and Kunar.
Officials suspect the cases are the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu but do not
yet have confirmation.
Last year, Afghanistan discovered cases of the H5N1 virus in birds, but not
humans.
The deadly strain of the bird flu virus has killed at least 160 people
worldwide since 2003.
