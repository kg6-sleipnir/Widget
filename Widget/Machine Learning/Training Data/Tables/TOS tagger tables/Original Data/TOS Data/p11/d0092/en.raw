Iraqi police say a car bomb in central Baghdad has killed at least 21 people
and wounded 66 others.
The blast damaged the Abdel Qadir Gilani Mosque, one of Baghdad's most revered
Sunni shrines.Â  The explosion also damaged several buildings and cars in the
Sinak area of the capital.
Another car bomb killed at least two people Monday in Baghdad's Bab al-Muadham
area.
In Iraq Sunday, U.S. military troops rescued 42 Iraqis from an al-Qaida prison
camp north of Baghdad.
Military officials say some of the freed captives showed signs of torture and
mistreatment.
