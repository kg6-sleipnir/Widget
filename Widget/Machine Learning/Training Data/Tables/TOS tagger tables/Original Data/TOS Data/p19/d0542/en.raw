Pop musician John Mayer will headline an upcoming concert to celebrate the 10th
anniversary of Save The Music.
Founded by the VH1 television network to promote music education in U.S. public
schools, the organization has reportedly provided $34 million worth of
instruments to schools around the country.
Scheduled for September 20 at New York City's Lincoln Center, the concert will
also feature 50 of the students the organization has helped over the past
decade.
