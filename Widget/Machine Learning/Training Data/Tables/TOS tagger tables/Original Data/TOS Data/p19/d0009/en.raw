A gauge of future U.S. economic activity shows the recession is likely to
continue another three to six months before recovery begins.

Monday's report from a business group, the Conference Board, says its index of
leading indicators fell 0.3 percent in March.

Economists watch stock prices, unemployment claims, building permits and other
factors to predict economic activity in the near future.

Some indicators are not falling as fast as they had been, prompting some
experts to predict the economy will begin to recover late this year.
