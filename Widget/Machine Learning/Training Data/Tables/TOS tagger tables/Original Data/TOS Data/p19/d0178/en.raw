Witnesses in Somalia say heavy fighting between Islamist insurgents and
Ethiopian troops has killed at least five people in the capital.

The latest fighting began after Islamic rebels attacked an Ethiopian military
base in Mogadishu.

Witnesses say several civilians were killed by stray bullets and mortar fire.

Ethiopian troops entered Somalia two years ago to help the interim government
fight an Islamist movement that was threatening to take over the country.

Somalia has been continuously torn by conflict since the fall of dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.
