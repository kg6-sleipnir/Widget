United Nations peacekeeping troops in Haiti have surrounded the residence of
ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, threatening to forcefully evict
demobilized soldiers who have seized the compound.
Haiti's interim government has ordered the rebels out of the compound in the
suburb of Tabarre. The government said Thursday U.N. troops will do whatever is
necessary to clear the residence.
The ex-soldiers - who helped lead the three-week rebellion that ousted Mr.
Aristide in February - moved into the compound on Wednesday.
Mr. Aristide is in exile in South Africa.
