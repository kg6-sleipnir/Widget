Ethiopia has reported 18 new cases of polio as it begins a nationwide
vaccination program targeting more than 16 million children under the age of
five.
A health ministry official says the polio cases were found in the Tigray,
Amhara and Oromia regions.
The country kicked off its polio immunization campaign on Wednesday with over
100,000 volunteers and health workers taking part.
Polio has spread in Africa and elsewhere as far as Indonesia following a 2003
boycott of immunizations by Islamic leaders in northern Nigeria. They claimed
the vaccine was contaminated.
