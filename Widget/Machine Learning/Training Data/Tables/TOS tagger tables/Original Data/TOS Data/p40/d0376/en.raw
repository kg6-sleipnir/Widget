Iran's judiciary says it is not ready to announce the verdicts of several al-
Qaida members who Tehran says were tried and sentenced in the Islamic state.
An Iranian judiciary official said Tuesday the verdicts will only be released
when all "legal obstacles are removed." He did not offer any details.
Iran has not said how many suspected al-Qaida members were on trial, or
released details on the charges against them.
Iran denies accusations that it has become a haven for al-Qaida militants.
