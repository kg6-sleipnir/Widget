Russia and China are conducting three days of joint anti-terrorism exercises in
Moscow.
The event began Tuesday with a simulation of a hostage situation in an
administrative building, complete with attackers wearing helmets and carrying
weapons.
The exercises are a followup to large-scale maneuvers last month that involved
not just Russia and China but also forces from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.
Those exercises were held near Chelyabinsk in Russia, near the border with
Kazakhstan.
