Police in India say at least 15 people were killed Sunday when a highway
overpass under construction collapsed in southern India.
About 10 people were also reported to be injured. It is unclear as to whether
any others were trapped.
The overpass was located in a busy commercial area in Hyderabad, the capital of
Andhra Pradesh state.
