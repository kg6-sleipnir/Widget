A closely-watched gauge of future U.S. economic activity rose sharply in
January, suggesting strong economic growth over the next few months.
A business group, the Conference Board in New York said Tuesday that its Index
of Leading Indicators rose a strong 1.1 percent for the month.
That is stronger than the reading for the previous month, and better than
economists expected.
Analysts, quoted by Bloomberg News say much of the rise was due to an improving
labor market.
