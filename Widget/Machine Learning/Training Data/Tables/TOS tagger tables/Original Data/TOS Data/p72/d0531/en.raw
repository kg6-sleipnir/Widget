Suspected rebels in Colombia have killed at least nine police officers and
wounded three others in an ambush on a remote highway.
Authorities say the officers were traveling in the mountains outside La Cruz,
southwest of Bogota Thursday, when the assailants used explosives to attack the
police vehicle.
Officials say rebels have killed more than 300 members of Colombia's armed
forces in attacks this year.
Colombia has been locked in a long-running civil war involving two leftist
rebel groups, rightist paramilitaries and the government. The conflict leaves
thousands of people dead each year.
