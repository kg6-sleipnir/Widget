Several dozen Palestinian police stormed the Palestinian parliament building
Monday to press demands for a security crackdown on Hamas militants.
There were no reports of shooting in the building, but witnesses say gunshots
were fired as police entered the legislative compound in Gaza City.
The police action followed a series of shootouts Sunday between Palestinian
police and Hamas militants. A Palestinian police commander and two civilian
bystanders were killed and at least 50 other people were wounded.
