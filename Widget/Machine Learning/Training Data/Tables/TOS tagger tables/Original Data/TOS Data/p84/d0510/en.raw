German police have arrested three Iraqi men suspected of planning an attack on
Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi during his visit to Germany.
A federal prosecutor told reporters Friday the men are suspected members of the
Islamic militant group Ansar al-Islam. They were arrested during raids in the
cities of Berlin, Augsberg, and Stuttgart.
Mr. Allawi was in Germany Friday for talks with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
