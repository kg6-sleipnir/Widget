The Indian budget airline, Kingfisher, has signed a $1.8 billion deal with the
world's largest commercial aircraft maker, Airbus, to acquire 30 jets.
Kingfisher, owned by India's largest beer company, expects to start operations
in April. It has contracted to buy 10 single-aisle planes with an option to buy
an additional 20 planes from the European aircraft consortium.
The deal comes as economic growth and a series of low-cost airlines such as
Kingfisher spurs an increase in air travel in India.
