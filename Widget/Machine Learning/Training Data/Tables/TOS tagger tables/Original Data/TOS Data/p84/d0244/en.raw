For decades Washington's National Air and Space Museum has been among the
city's top tourist attractions. It is an impressively large building - located
within sight of the U.S. Capitol Building - and operated by the non-profit
Smithsonian Institution, which manages the collection. But in spite of its
spacious proportions, the museum had - for years - been able to display only
about 10 percent of the Institution's vast collection. VOA's George Dwyer
reports another even larger facility was opened four years ago. Jim Bertel
narrates.
