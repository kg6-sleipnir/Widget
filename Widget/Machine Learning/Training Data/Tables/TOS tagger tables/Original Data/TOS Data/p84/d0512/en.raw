A tour bus crash in Jordan has killed six people and injured 28 others,
including an Iraqi minister.

Security officials say the victims were on a bus that was returning from the
Dead Sea to the capital Amman, late Thursday.

Authorities say two British women and four Iraqis were killed. Iraqi Minister
of Science and Technology Raed Fahmi was hospitalized, with injuries.

The bus passengers were taking part in a United Nations Development Program
training course for Iraqis.  The two women killed were employees of the
training program.
