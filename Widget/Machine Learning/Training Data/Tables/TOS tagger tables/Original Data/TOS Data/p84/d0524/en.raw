Palestinian security officials say Israeli aircraft have fired missiles at a
car traveling in the southern Gaza Strip, killing at least one person and
wounding three others.
There was no immediate response from Israel.
On Wednesday, four Palestinian militants with the Popular Resistance Committee
were killed in an Israeli airstrike on Gaza.
