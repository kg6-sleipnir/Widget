The Akamba Handicraft Industry Cooperative is well know for its carvings
throughout Kenya and other parts of the world. Members' carvings have delighted
tourists and othercustomers since the cooperative's inception in the late
1960s. Thousands of carvers produce vivid images of animals, masks, bowls and
other objects. Cathy Majtenyi recently visited the cooperative's workshops in
the coastal town of Mombasa.
