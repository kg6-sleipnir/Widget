Authorities in Pakistan say unidentified gunmen killed seven people near the
Afghan border Thursday.
They say the gunmen opened fire on a vehicle carrying the men near the town of
Wana, in the remote tribal region of South Waziristan. It was not clear who the
victims were.
Pakistan has thousands of troops deployed in the region to hunt for al-Qaida
and Taleban fighters.
