Palestinian witnesses say Israeli troops shot and killed two Palestinian
civilians in separate incidents in the West Bank and Gaza Strip Tuesday.
They say soldiers shot dead a Palestinian bystander during a clash with
militants  in Nablus.  Several Palestinians and two soldiers were wounded in
the clash that erupted when Israeli troops raided the Palestinian city.
Israeli forces regularly mount raids into West Bank towns to arrest wanted
Palestinians.
In the Gaza Strip, witnesses say a Palestinian farmer was killed when Israeli
forces fired tank or artillery shells into the territory.
