Police in Mauritania say security forces have arrested the leaders of a
terrorist cell with alleged links to al-Qaida.
The detainees are said to be prominent leaders in the guerrilla group, Salafist
Group for Preaching and Combat.
A statement from the national police says seven people were arrested earlier
this week as they returned from the group's training camp in Algeria. The
detainees are said to be among a total of 20 guerrillas who were sent to the
camp for training.
