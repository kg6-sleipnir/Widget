The United Nations weather agency says 2010 is set to be one of the three
warmest years on record, and possibly the warmest ever.

The World Meteorological Organization says the past 10 years, 2001-2010, have
also set a new record for the warmest decade, with the highest worldwide
temperatures since records began in 1850.

The WMO released the data Thursday at U.N. climate change talks in Cancun,
Mexico.

Figures for November and December will be factored in early next year.
