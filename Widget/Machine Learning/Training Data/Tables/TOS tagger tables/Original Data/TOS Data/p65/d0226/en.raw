Spanish police in raids across the country have arrested 186 people in a
crackdown on the distribution of child pornography.
A total of 650 officers took part in the operation that broke up a system that
used the Internet to distribute pornographic materials without the need to
place them on web pages. The suspects used a series of pre-arranged passwords
to share files directly between computers.
Last month, Spanish police broke up a group of pedophiles who abused and raped
children then distributed the images over the Internet.
