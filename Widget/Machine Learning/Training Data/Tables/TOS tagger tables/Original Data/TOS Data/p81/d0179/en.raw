A press spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative, Neena Moorjani, says
delays are common in free trade talks.
Moorjani would not comment on any link between the political storm over DP
World and the delay in the talks.
But a major business group says the controversy over the ports deal could hurt
Washington's ability to promote free trade around the world and foreign
investment here at home.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says foreigners invest $80 billion in the United
States a year, creating five million jobs.
