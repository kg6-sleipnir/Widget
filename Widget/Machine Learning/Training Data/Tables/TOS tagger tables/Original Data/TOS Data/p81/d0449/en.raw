Police in northern Nigeria say 36 people were killed late Saturday when two
buses collided head-on and burst into flames.
A police spokesman says the accident occurred in the town of Birnin-Kudu in
Jigawa state.
He says five people survived the crash and were being treated at a hospital.
A witness told the Associated Press that one of the buses was trying to
overtake a small vehicle at a sharp bend when the accident occurred.
The witness said most of the people killed in the crash were "burnt beyond
recognition."
