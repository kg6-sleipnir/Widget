Police say unknown attackers have killed at least seven police officers in
central Pakistan.

The attack happened early Saturday near the town of Mianwali, in Punjab
province.  Police say militants first opened fire on a police checkpoint and
then blew it up with explosives.

The outpost building was destroyed in the blast.

Security officials say it is not clear who is behind the attack.

Mianwali is near the restive North West Frontier Province, where Pakistani
security forces have been battling pro-Taliban militants.
