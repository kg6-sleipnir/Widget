Pakistani police say at least five people have been killed in an ambush on a
cricket match in the southwestern city of Quetta.
Police say the five - described as young men - were gunned down Friday by
unidentified attackers on a motorcycle.
At least three other people were injured.
After the shooting, angry mobs blocked a nearby road.
The region's chief minister, Nawab Raisani, visited the victims at the
hospital.
He condemned the killings and told reporters attacks on unarmed civilians will
not be tolerated.
