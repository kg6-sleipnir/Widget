Reports from Rangoon say the military government of Burma quietly sentenced a
Buddhist monk to seven years in prison during the visit this week of a United
Nations human rights envoy.

A lawyer said Saturday that U Gaw Thita was arrested last August as he returned
from a trip to Taiwan.  He was convicted at Burma's notorious Insein Prison
Wednesday on three charges including unlawful association.

The lawyer said the monk was also convicted of failing to declare possession of
foreign currency and for violation of immigration laws for taking the trip.
