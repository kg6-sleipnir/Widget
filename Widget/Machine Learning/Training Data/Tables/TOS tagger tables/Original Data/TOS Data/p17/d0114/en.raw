Haiti's chief elections official has fled the country after receiving threats
following this month's presidential elections.
Officials say Jacques Bernard flew to the United States on Sunday, a day after
his farmhouse was ransacked.
Bernard was accused by some people who supported candidate Rene Preval of
manipulating the vote count to prevent Preval from claiming an outright victory
and avoid a runoff vote.
Preval was declared the winner last week in an internationally-brokered
decision to divide 85,000 blank ballots proportionately among the candidates.
