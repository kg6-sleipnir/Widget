Authorities in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul say two Christian churches have
been the target of nearly simultaneous bomb attacks.
Witnesses say gunmen stormed the Armenian and Chaldean churches Tuesday,
planting explosives that detonated, setting the buildings on fire.Â  No
casualties have been confirmed.
Iraq's minority Christian community has been the target of attacks before, most
recently last month when three people were killed in a bomb attack on a Baghdad
church.
Meanwhile, the U.S. military says an American soldier was killed Tuesday while
on patrol in Baghdad.
