Former Darfur rebels said Friday they rescued a kidnapped Chinese worker in
Sudan's Darfur region.

Reuters news agency reports the engineer was in good health.

A Sudanese army spokesman said Wednesday he had information the engineer had
been taken hostage in neighboring Chad.

Last month three Russian pilots were kidnapped in Sudan's Darfur region at
gunpoint and held for two days.

They were released one day after an American aid worker was freed in Darfur
after being held captive for more than 100 days.
