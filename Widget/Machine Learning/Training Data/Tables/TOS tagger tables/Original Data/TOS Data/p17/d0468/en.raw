Afghan officials say three police officers have been killed in two different
suicide bombings Tuesday.
Authorities say one officer was killed when a bomber rammed a police car in the
southern province of Paktika, near the border with Pakistan.
They say the other bombing took place in the relatively quiet province of
Kunduz, when a bomber detonated his car while being followed by police. That
blast killed two policemen.
Separately, government officials said unidentified gunmen kidnapped two workers
from the ministry of rural development. That abduction occurred Monday in the
western province of Nimroz.
