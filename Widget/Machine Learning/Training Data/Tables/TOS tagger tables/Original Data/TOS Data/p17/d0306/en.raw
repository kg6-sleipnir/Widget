The European Union has imposed more sanctions on Burma.
The new sanctions, adopted at an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels,
include an embargo on the import of timber, gems and metals from Burma.
They also extend a list of Burmese leaders and their relatives subject to a
travel ban and assets freeze.
The EU foreign ministers urged Burma's military government to enter into a
"meaningful dialogue" that will lead to democracy. They also called for the
lifting of all restrictions on detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
