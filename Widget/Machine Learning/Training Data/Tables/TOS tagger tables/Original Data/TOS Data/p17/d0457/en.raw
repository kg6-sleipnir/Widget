A new law comes into effect in Brazil Sunday, allowing the country's air force
to shoot down planes suspected of smuggling drugs.
Drug traffickers frequently fly over Brazil while smuggling drugs from
neighboring Colombia. Bogota also has a similar shoot-down policy.
Brazilian officials say air force pilots must follow an eight-step procedure
before shooting at a suspected drug plane.
Critics say that despite those steps, the chance of human error remains and
innocent people could be killed.
Such a mistake occurred in Peru in 2001, and an American missionary and her
child were killed.
