Israeli security officials say they re-arrested nuclear-whistle blower
Mordechai Vanunu early Thursday.
Officials say Vanunu is suspected of giving unauthorized information to
foreigners.
He was set free in April, after serving 18 years in prison for divulging
classified information about Israel's nuclear program to the London Sunday
Times.
Under conditions of his release, Vanunu is still barred from leaving the
country or discussing Israel's nuclear program. His contacts with foreigners
also are restricted.
