Organizers of the vote by Iraqi expatriates say some two-thirds of eligable
Iraqis living abroad have participated in the historic election so far.
The International Organization for Migration said Sunday more than 186,000
Iraqis voted Friday and Saturday in the Middle East, North America, Australia
and Western Europe.
The three-day process runs until the end of Sunday across 36 cities in 14
nations, including Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Iran,
Jordan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates and the
United States.
