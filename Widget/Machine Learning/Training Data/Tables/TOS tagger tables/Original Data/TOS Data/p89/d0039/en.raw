A New York jury has convicted a Yemeni cleric and his assistant of charges of
conspiring to fund the Islamic terror groups al-Qaida and Hamas.
Sheik Mohammed Ali Hassan al-Moayad and Mohammed Yahya Zayed were arrested in
an FBI operation in Frankfurt, Germany in 2003.
Undercover agents videotaped them offering to send money to the terror groups.
Their lawyers called them victims of entrapment.
The jury Thursday also found al-Moyad guilty of actually providing support to
Hamas, but acquitted him of charges of sending such backing to al-Qaida.
