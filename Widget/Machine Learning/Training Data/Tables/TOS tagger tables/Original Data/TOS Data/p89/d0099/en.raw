Indonesian officials say they will require foreigners who want to work in the
country to pass a language proficiency test before giving them work permits.
Would-be workers will have to show competency in the national language, Bahasa
Indonesia, although the degree of proficiency needed might vary depending on
how much direct contact with Indonesians the job requires.
The officials did not give a starting date for the language requirement.
Indonesia is to open its doors to job seekers from other members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations next year under a regional free trade
agreement.
