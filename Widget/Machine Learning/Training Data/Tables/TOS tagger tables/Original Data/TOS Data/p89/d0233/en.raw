El Salvador has sent a fourth contingent of soldiers to Iraq. 
Roughly 380 soldiers from the Cuscatlan Battalion left a military base Thursday
for their six-month tour of duty in Iraq.  Officials say the troops will make a
stop in Kuwait.
The Salvadorans will replace 380 troops who have been in Iraq since last
August.
El Salvador is the only Latin American country with troops in Iraq.  Honduras,
Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic have withdrawn their forces.
Last April, one Salvadoran soldier was killed and 12 others wounded during a
clash with insurgents.
