The modern circus can trace its roots to ancient Rome where audiences gathered
to see chariot races, equestrian shows, and staged battles.  Today's modern
circuses have changed quite a bit with a mix of aerialists, clowns and theater
all designed to thrill and entertain audiences. But these modern shows are not
without controversy. VOA's Jeff Feuer goes behind the scenes at the Ringling
Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, the self described "Greatest Show on
Earth," to learn how the performers try to help the communities they come to
entertain.
