Security forces in Indonesia are on guard to prevent attacks as Christians in
the mostly Muslim country celebrate Christmas.
Sixty-one thousand security personnel are protecting churches and other
possible terrorist targets. Seventeen thousand security officers are on duty in
Jakarta, some dressed like Santa Claus.
Officials are concerned that the Islamist extremist group, Jemaah Islamiyah,
might use group's bomb-making expert, Azahari Husin, last month.
Church bombings in Indonesia on Christmas Eve, December 24, five years ago
killed 19 people. Officials suspect Jemaah Islamiyah carried out those attacks.
