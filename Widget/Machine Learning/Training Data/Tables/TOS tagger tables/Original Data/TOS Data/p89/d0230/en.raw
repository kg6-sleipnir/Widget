Longwood Gardens in the eastern state of Pennsylvania has been described by
many visitors as a horticultural paradise and attracts hundreds of thousands of
nature lovers each year.   Over the lush 424 hectares there are more than 40
different gardens and displays. VOA's Amitis Darabnia takes us inside the
garden's conservatory, a large indoor facility that is home to 5,500 types of
plants. Natalie Breen narrates.
