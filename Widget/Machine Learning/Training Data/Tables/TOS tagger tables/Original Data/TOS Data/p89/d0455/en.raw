A U.S. judge has ordered Sudan to pay nearly eight million dollars to the
families of 17 sailors killed in the 2000 terrorist attack on the Navy's USS
Cole in Yemen.
The judge announced the ruling Wednesday in Washington, D.C.
Families of the victims accused Sudan of providing financial support and
training to members of the al-Qaida terror network.Â  In March, the judge ruled
that Sudan should be held accountable for the incident.
Two Yemeni al-Qaida-linked terrorists carried out the suicide attack on the
U.S. navy ship in the port of Aden.
