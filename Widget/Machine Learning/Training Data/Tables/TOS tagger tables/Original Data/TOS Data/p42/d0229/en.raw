The world's stock markets posted mixed results Wednesday after a week of
turmoil that saw steep losses and some recovery.
The major U.S. stock market indexes lost around three-tenths of a percent after
rising oil prices discouraged traders.
European stock market indexes moved up two-tenths of a percent or more.
Dealers say many investors are concerned that the global market sell-off that
began last week may resume.Â 
Earlier in Asia, major indices fell almost one percent in Mumbai and Hong Kong,
while Tokyo was down half-a-percent at the close.
