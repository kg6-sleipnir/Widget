Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is reported to have called Israel the
"flag of Satan."
The state-run IRNA news agency says the Iranian leader made the comment to a
religious conference. It quotes him saying that when the philosophy of a state
is in question, it may be on the path to decline and dissolution.
Mr. Ahmadinejad sparked international outrage in 2005 when he said Israel
should be wiped off the map. He has also called the Holocaust a myth.
