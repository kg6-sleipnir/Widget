Authorities in Indian Kashmir say militants have raided a police station,
killing two officers and stealing a cache of weapons.
Police officials say at least one officer assisted the group of militants in
the attack late Friday in the remote Doda district. Police gave few details of
the attack.
Officials say security forces are searching for the attackers, who fled after
the raid.
Kashmir is in the midst of a 17-year insurgency that has claimed more than
45,000 lives. Various rebel groups are fighting for an independent Kashmir or
its merger with Pakistan.
