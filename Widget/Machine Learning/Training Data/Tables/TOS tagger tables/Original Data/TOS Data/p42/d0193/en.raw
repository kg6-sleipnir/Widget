British police have been out in force in Edinburgh, Scotland, Monday, where
demonstrators have begun protesting the G-Eight conference of industrialized
nations that opens Wednesday.
An undetermined number of arrests were reported after some of the protesters
scuffled with police.Â  There were no reports of serious violence.
Advocates of several causes have descended to promote their causes, including
representatives from anti-military, anti-nuclear, and anti-globalization
groups.
