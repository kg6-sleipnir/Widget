Iraqi officials say Turkish warplanes have bombed targets in the Kurdish
autonomous region of northern Iraq, wounding one civilian.

The officials say Turkey bombed the village of Sidakan near the Iranian border
Saturday.

There was no immediate confirmation of the strike from the Turkish military.

Clashes between Turks and Kurds have increased since the Kurdistan Workers'
Party, or PKK, called off a yearlong cease-fire in June.Â  The group cited
repeated Turkish military attacks for ending the truce.

The PKK is fighting for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey, and has bases
in northern Iraq.
