A series of discouraging reports on the U.S. economy has brought sharp
criticism from the Democrat who heads a key economic committee.
Senator Charles Schumer said Friday reports showing a declining job market and
record-high foreclosures are more evidence that the U.S. economy is headed for
recession.
Schumer accuses the Bush administration of doing far too little to fend off the
economic crisis.
White House spokesman Tony Fratto says the economy is in for a "difficult
quarter," but notes that the new stimulus plan is just getting underway.  He
says it should restore economic growth.
