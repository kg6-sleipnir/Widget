Police in Nepal have detained more than 50 Tibetan protesters as they prepared
to demonstrate near the Chinese embassy in Kathmandu.
The protesters were traveling to the embassy in buses when they were stopped by
police and driven to detention centers.
Nepal is home to some 20,000 Tibetan refugees and has seen daily, pro-Tibet
demonstrations since violence erupted in Tibet in March.
Police have been detaining the protesters but are generally freeing them the
same day.
Nepal regards Tibet as part of China.
