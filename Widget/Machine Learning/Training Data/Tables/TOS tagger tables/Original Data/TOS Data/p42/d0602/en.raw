French President Nicolas Sarkozy says France is willing to help Egypt develop
nuclear power plants.
In an interview published Saturday in the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, Mr.
Sarkozy said France will cooperate and work together with Egypt if the Cairo
government wants to develop civilians uses for nuclear technology.
Earlier this year, authorities in Cairo announced that Egypt intends to build
several nuclear reactors to meet its future energy needs.
The French president has been vacationing in Egypt in advance of an official
state visit he will begin on Sunday in Cairo.
