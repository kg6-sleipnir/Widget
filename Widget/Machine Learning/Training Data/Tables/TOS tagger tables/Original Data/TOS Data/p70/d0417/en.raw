A written statement purportedly from Taleban leader Mullah Omar mourns the
death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, and vows to keep fighting in Afghanistan.
In the statement that surfaced Friday in Pakistan, Omar said Zarqawi's death -
described as "martyrdom" - would not weaken the resistance movement in Iraq or
stop the battle in Afghanistan.
The authenticity of the statement could not be confirmed.
