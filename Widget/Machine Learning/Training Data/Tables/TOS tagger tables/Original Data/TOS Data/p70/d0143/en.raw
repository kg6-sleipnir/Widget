In Pakistan local officials say Pakistani troops have killed at least eight
militants in clashes in the northwest region of the country.
The French news agency reports that two underground hideouts used by militants
were also captured in Sunday's operation in the restive Orakzai tribal
district.
Pakistan's military launched an offensive against Taliban insurgents in Orakzai
in March, to target militants who are believed to have fled an earlier military
offensive in South Waziristan.
