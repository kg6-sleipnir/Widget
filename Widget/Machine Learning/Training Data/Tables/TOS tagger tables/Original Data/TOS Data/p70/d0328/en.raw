Russia has called on Iran to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy
Agency and clear up remaining questions about its nuclear program.
The Russian foreign ministry made the comments in a statement Saturday evening
after the U.N. nuclear agency's board found that Iran failed to comply with
international nuclear safeguard agreements, but did not vote to refer the
matter to the U.N. Security Council.
Russia, which is helping Iran build a nuclear power plant, was one of 12
nations that abstained from voting on Saturday's IAEA resolution.
