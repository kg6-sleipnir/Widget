Witnesses say at least 15 people have been killed in two days of ongoing
clashes between rival Islamist groups in central Somalia.

Clashes in the town of Wabho mainly involved fighters from the al-Shabab group
and its rival the, Ahlu Sunna Wajama.

Residents say many civilians have been injured since the violence erupted
Saturday.

Reports say the pro-government Ahlu Sunna Wajama reportedly attacked the
Shabab-held village.

The two sides have fought repeatedly for control over the region.
