Pirates have hijacked a Greek-owned cargo vessel in the Gulf of Aden, off the
coast of Somalia.

The Greek merchant marine ministry says pirates seized the MV Saldanha early
Sunday, as it headed toward Slovenia with a load of coal.

The ministry says the ship was carrying 22 crew members, their nationalities
unknown.

Somali pirates have received millions of dollars in ransom payments during a
hijacking spree over the past year.Â 

The attacks have continued despite increased naval patrols by the U.S.,
European Union and other world powers.
