Saudi officials say security forces have killed a suspected militant in the
western city of Jeddah after the man tried to use a hand grenade against them.
Officials said the incident took place Saturday after security forces
surrounded the man's vehicle in the city's Jamia district.
They said police found guns, ammunition, hand grenades, pipe bombs, and money
in the car.
Saudi officials have blamed al-Qaida militants for a wave of violence that has
claimed dozens of lives in the kingdom since May of last year.
