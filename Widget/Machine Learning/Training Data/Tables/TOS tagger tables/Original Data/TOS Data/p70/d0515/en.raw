Reports from Syria say a small aircraft apparently used by the military has
crashed near Damascus, killing three people on board.
Witnesses said the plane appeared to be on a training flight Sunday when it
came down.
There was no immediate confirmation of the incident from Syrian officials.
The plane crash happened at a time of heightened tension between Syria and
Israel, which carried out an air strike deep inside Syrian territory on
September 6. Neither country has given much information about the target of the
Israeli raid.
