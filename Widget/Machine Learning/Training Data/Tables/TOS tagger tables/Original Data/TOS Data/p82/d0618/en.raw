Gunmen in southern Nigeria kidnapped two Russians early Saturday in the latest
abduction of foreigners in the oil-rich delta region.

The victims are employees of the Russian aluminum company UC Rusal.  They were
taken from a company compound in the port town of Ikot Abasi.

More than 200 foreigners have been kidnapped in nearly three years of violence
across the south of the country.  The hostages usually are released after a
ransom is paid.

A Scottish worker kidnapped in the same region a month ago was recently freed
unharmed.
