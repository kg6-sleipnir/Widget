One of Italy's most noted film directors, Luigi Comencini, has died at age 90.
Comencini is best known for his 1953 film Pane, Amore e Fantasia (Bread, Love
and Dreams), which starred Gina Lollobrigida and Vittorio De Sica.
The director often focused on children and childhood in his many films.
Two of Comencini's daughters followed in his footsteps as filmmakers.
Cristina Comencini directed the highly acclaimed La Bestia Nel Cuore (Don't
Tell), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at Hollywood's famed
Academy Awards.
