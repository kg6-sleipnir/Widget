Witnesses say nearly 20 dead whales have washed up Wednesday on a beach in
Dakar, Senegal.
Dakar journalist Ricci Shryock tells VOA national police are removing the
carcasses in trucks. She said the whales measure some 3.5 to 4.5 meters.
Local villagers say as many as 100 whales swam up to shore late Tuesday night.
Fisherman were able to tow some of the animals out to sea.
It is unclear why the animals swam close to shore.
