Iraq's government says Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki will make his first
official visit to Iran on Monday.
Officials say his two-day visit will focus on security issues and promoting
bilateral relations.
Earlier this week, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh led a delegation of
officials on a visit to Iran aimed at enhancing economic ties between the two
nations.
Iraq and Iran fought a bloody war in the 1980s when then-Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein was in power. The neighboring countries have tried to build closer ties
in recent years.
