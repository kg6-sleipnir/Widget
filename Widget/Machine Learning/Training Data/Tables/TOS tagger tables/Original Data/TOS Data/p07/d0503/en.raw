 The U.S. military in Iraq says a roadside bomb has killed one of its troops
south of the capital, Baghdad.

The military says the soldier was killed Thursday when his vehicle hit the bomb
during a combat patrol near Iskandariyah.

The United States invaded Iraq in 2003, citing concerns about alleged weapons
of mass destruction programs.  No such weapons were found.
