Colombian police say U.S. and Colombian drug enforcement agents have dismantled
a major narcotics smuggling operation.
Authorities say the drug ring had been smuggling huge amounts of heroin and
cocaine into the United States from Latin America.
At least 27 people were arrested in the operation, most of them in Colombia.
Police say they also confiscated 61 kilograms of heroin and at least 129
kilograms of cocaine, worth more than seven million dollars.
Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, most of which is shipped
to the United States.
