NATO says two alliance soldiers have been killed and three others wounded in a
firefight with Taliban insurgents in eastern Afghanistan.
In a statement, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force says the
fighting erupted when insurgents ambushed a joint NATO-Afghan troop patrol in
the Korangal Valley of Kunar province late Thursday.
NATO did not identify the nationalities of the dead and wounded soldiers.
NATO and U.S. forces are battling a resurgent Taliban presence in Afghanistan.
The group increasingly has used suicide attacks and roadside bomb blasts since
U.S.-led forces ousted it from power in the late 2001.
