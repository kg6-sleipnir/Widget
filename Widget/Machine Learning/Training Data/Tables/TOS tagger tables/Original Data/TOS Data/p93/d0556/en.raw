Germany's supreme court has ruled against a law allowing the German air force
to shoot down hijacked airliners to prevent a terrorist attack.
The country's highest court ruled Wednesday the law violates the German
constitution. The legislation came under fire by critics who said the state
does not have the right to kill innocent civilians to save others' lives.
The government proposed the law following the terrorist attacks on New York and
Washington in 2001, and drafted the legislation after a German man threatened
to crash an airplane into a Frankfurt building in 2003.
