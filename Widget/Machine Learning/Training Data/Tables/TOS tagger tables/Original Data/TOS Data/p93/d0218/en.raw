Avril Lavigne has no sympathy for Britney Spears. Speaking to the LondonÂ Sun,
the 22-year-old pop-rock singer says Spears simply isn't tough enough for show
business.
"You can't complain about the pressures, the paparazi, the madness," she says,
"because that's the job."
Avril Lavigne had her own widely-publicized run-ins with celebrity lensmen last
September, when she was photographed spitting at paparazzi on two separate
occasions.
Her third album The Best Damn Thing is scheduled for an April 17 release.
