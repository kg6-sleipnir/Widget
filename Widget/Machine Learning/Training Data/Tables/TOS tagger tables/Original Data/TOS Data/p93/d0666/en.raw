The U.S. military says attackers threw two grenades into a crowd in the Iraqi
city of Fallujah, injuring 20 people.
U.S. officials said Saturday, they had received no reports of Iraqi military
casualties in the attack. But hospital sources said three Iraqi soldiers were
injured.
Meanwhile, an American soldier was killed when his vehicle struck an explosive
device in Baghdad.
And gunmen injured the head of Iraq's border guard, Major General Ali Hamadi,
who was driving in the Iraqi capital.
