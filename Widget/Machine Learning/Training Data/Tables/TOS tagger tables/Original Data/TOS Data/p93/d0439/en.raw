Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez says the government will seize private land
and tourist resorts to house the thousands of people made homeless by the worst
flooding in 40 years.

Mr. Chavez ordered the government to seize nearly 36 hectares of privately
owned land near the national airport and authorized the building of thousands
of housing units.

He also authorized officials to take over unused hotel rooms and tourist
resorts.

At least 32 people have died and more than 70,000 left homeless by flooding due
to heavy rains in recent days.
