This week, the United Nations is expected to issue an appeal for up to 40
million dollars to help Somalia recover from last week’s tsunami. 
The latest death toll in Somalia is around 140, according to figures from the
transitional government. 
Elballa Hagona is the Acting UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia.  From
Nairobi, he told English to Africa reporter Joe De Capua that the assessment of
the country continues and a final report should be available in a few days.
