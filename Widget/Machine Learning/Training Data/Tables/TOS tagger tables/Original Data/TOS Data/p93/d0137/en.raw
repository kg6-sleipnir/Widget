The National Museum of the Marine Corps opened in November 2006 to honor and
celebrate more than 200 years of military history. Located adjacent to the
Quantico Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, the museum offers visitors an
interactive environment that highlights the values, culture and mission of the
U.S. Marine Corps.  For producer Liu Enming, Elaine Lu has more.
