Authorities have lost control of a southern Afghanistan district after Taleban
fighters attacked and disarmed police late Thursday.
Reports from Musa Qala in the southern province of Helmand say hundreds of
Taleban fighters seized the town, destroying part of its district headquarters.
The Associated press quotes a spokesman for NATO forces in Afghanistan, Colonel
Tom Collins, as saying an unknown number of militants apparently entered Musa
Qala.
British forces pulled out of the town last year after a peace deal was signed
between local elders and the Helmand provincial government.
