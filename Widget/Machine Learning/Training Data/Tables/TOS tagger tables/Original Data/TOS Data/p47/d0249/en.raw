Afghan authorities say U.S-led coalition forces have arrested five suspected
Taleban insurgents in connection with an attack on a oil tanker that killed two
Pakistanis.
Police in the Afghan border town of Spin Boldak said the five suspects were
apprehended Wednesday - a day after the two Pakistani nationals were killed in
the same area.
The victims were ambushed after the Pakistani-owned tanker delivered fuel to a
U.S. base in southern Afghanistan.
Taleban and allied militants have stepped up attacks in recent months, often
hitting soft targets associated with coalition forces and the Afghan government
of President Hamid Karzai.
