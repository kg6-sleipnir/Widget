The Afghan intelligence agency says officials have arrested 17 would-be suicide
bombers who allegedly trained in Pakistan.
A spokesman for the intelligence agency says security agents detained the
suspects before they had a chance to strike targets in Afghanistan.
He says the detainees told authorities they had attended militant training
camps in neighboring Pakistan.
The Afghan spokesman says militants in Pakistan encourage fighters to carry out
suicide attacks by telling them Islam is in danger in Afghanistan.
Pakistani and Afghan authorities have accused each other of not doing enough to
combat the Taleban-led insurgency in Afghanistan.
