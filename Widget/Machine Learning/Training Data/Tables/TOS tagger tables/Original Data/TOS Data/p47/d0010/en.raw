The US Gulf Coast city of New Orleans escaped a major disaster this week when
Hurricane Gustav hit shore some 110 kilometers southwest of the legendary
city.  Three years ago, New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. VOA's
Barry Wood reports the city is cleaning up from a storm that could have been
much worse.
