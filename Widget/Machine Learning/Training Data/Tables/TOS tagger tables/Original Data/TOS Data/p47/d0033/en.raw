Nigerian government officials say former Liberian leader and war crimes suspect
Charles Taylor has disappeared from the house where he was living in exile in
Nigeria.
They say Taylor left his villa in the southern town of Calabar Monday night.
His disappearance came just after the Nigerian government said they were
willing to allow Liberia to arrest Taylor. The United Nations war crimes
tribunal for Sierra Leone had asked for his arrest on charges of rape and
torture related to his rule in Liberia and a civil war in neighboring Sierra
Leone.
