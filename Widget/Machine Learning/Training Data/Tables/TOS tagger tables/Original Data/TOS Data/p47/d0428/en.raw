Authorities in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh say at least 11
people were killed Sunday afternoon when a bus packed with passengers veered
off a road and plunged into a canal.
The authorities say the accident happened in the Bulandshahr district after the
driver lost control of the vehicle. They say 11 bodies have been recovered by
rescue workers, but cautioned the death toll could rise.
The rescue operation continued into the night.
India is plagued by traffic accidents due to poorly maintained vehicles and
roads, and hazardous driving.
