A religious festival that drew millions of Shi'ite pilgrims to Iraq's holy city
of Karbala has ended without major incident.
Heavy security was in place Saturday for the festival of Shaaban. It
commemorates the birth of ninth-century Imam al-Mahdi al-Muntadar.
Violence elsewhere in Iraq killed at least 12 people.  Bomb attacks in Baghdad
left at least two people dead.  And a gunman killed an employee of Iraq's
government-run newspaper in the capital.
On Friday, insurgents firing mortar rounds killed at least three Shi'ite
pilgrims in a procession near Karbala.
