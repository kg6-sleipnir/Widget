A prison riot in Venezuela has killed seven inmates and wounded 11 more.
Prison officials said the riot broke out late Monday, as inmates battled for
control of cell blocks inside the prison west of Caracas.
It is unclear whether prison authorities have quelled the riot.
Violence is common in Venezuela's overcrowded prisons, where about 20,000
inmates live in facilities built to hold 15,000 people.
