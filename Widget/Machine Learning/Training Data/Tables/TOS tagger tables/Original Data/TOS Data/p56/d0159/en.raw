Bolivian President Evo Morales says he will not agree to a U.S. request to
return weapons and equipment in an ongoing disagreement over the naming of a
new commander for Bolivia's counterterrorism unit.
Mr. Morales responded Tuesday to a written request by the U.S. Embassy that
objected to the new unit commander. Mr. Morales has called the U.S. request
blackmail.
U.S. officials have confirmed that Washington will cancel its counterterrorism
programs in Bolivia after its decision last week to drop the country from its
list of anti-terrorism partners.
