Thousands of people in cities across Britain have rallied to protest Israeli
military action in Lebanon.
A march through central London Saturday drew the largest numbers. Police
estimate that crowd at seven thousand people. Many of them carried Lebanese
flags.
British Muslim groups organized the protests.
The current Mideast crisis began July 12, when Hezbollah guerrillas kidnapped
two Israeli soldiers and killed eight in a raid. Israel then launched an
offensive on Hezbollah militias based in Lebanon.
More than 300 Lebanese and 34 Israelis have died in the violence.
Hundreds more have been wounded.
