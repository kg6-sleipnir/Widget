Iraqi authorities have freed more prisoners under a national reconciliation
plan announced last week by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.
Several hundred detainees were released Thursday from the U.S.-run Abu Ghraib
prison, west of Baghdad, and other facilities across the country.
U.S. officials say more prisoners will be freed Friday.
Some 600 prisoners were released last week.
Mr. Maliki has promised to free 2,500 prisoners by the end of the month to
foster "reconciliation and national dialogue."
Authorities say those being freed are not involved in violent crimes or had
been detained by mistake.
