Cuba says it has restored formal relations with Spain, a year after the
European Union imposed diplomatic sanctions on the communist island.
Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque announced the decision Thursday,
shortly before a meeting in Havana with new Spanish Ambassador Carlos Zaldivar.
The European Union imposed the sanctions after Cuba's 2003 detainment of 75
dissidents, and the execution of three men who tried to hijack a ferry to the
United States.Â 
No additional information has been given by either government.
