The White House says President Bush will hold a news conference shortly.
A spokeswoman did not say what topics the president plans to address in the
meeting with reporters, which is scheduled to take place in the Rose Garden of
the White House.
The announcement comes one day after the president nominated White House
Counsel Harriet Miers to replace retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the
Supreme Court.
