Iraq executed three convicted murderers Thursday - the first time the
government has carried out the death penalty since Saddam Hussein was in power.
A government spokesman, Laith Kubba, told reporters that the three were hanged
at 10 AM local time.
They were convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder.
The presidential council approved their death sentences last month. But
President Jalal Talabani, who opposes the death penalty, refused to authorize
the hangings, and instead empowered one of his vice presidents to sign on his
behalf.
