President Vladimir Putin says his country is developing and testing new nuclear
missile systems that are not like those available to any other nuclear power.
Russian news agencies quote the Russian leader who made the comments Wednesday
in a speech to a group of high-ranking military officials. They quote him as
saying he expects to see the new systems put in service in the near future.
The reports say Mr. Putin warned of the dangers of international terrorism,
saying Russia will face new threats if it does not develop its nuclear and
missile shield systems.
