The U.S. military says it has arrested four suspected militants in the northern
Iraqi city of Mosul.

Officials said Thursday one of the detained men is believed to have ties to a
top al-Qaida in Iraq insurgent killed in Mosul earlier this month.

The military announced Wednesday that it had identified the militant killed
October fifth as Abu Qaswarah, also known as Abu Sara.Â  U.S. officials say the
Moroccan-born man was the second in command of al-Qaida in Iraq.

The U.S.-led coalition said his death will cause a major disruption to the al-
Qaida in Iraq network.
