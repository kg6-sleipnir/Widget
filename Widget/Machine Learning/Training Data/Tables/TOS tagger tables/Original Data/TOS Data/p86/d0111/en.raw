Saudi Arabia says the leader of the al-Qaida network in the kingdom was among
those killed in a shootout with security forces Monday.
The Saudi Interior Ministry said Tuesday the al-Qaida leader was killed along
with four other men wanted for last week's failed attempt to bomb a massive oil
processing plant.
Saudi officials say a sixth suspected militant was arrested in a separate raid
Monday and will be interrogated.
Al-Qaida's Saudi branch says it was behind last week's attempted attack and has
vowed to hit other Saudi oil installations.
