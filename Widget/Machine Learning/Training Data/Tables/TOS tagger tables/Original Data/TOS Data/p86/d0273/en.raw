Afghan authorities say shots fired near the Afghan defense minister on Saturday
were not an assassination attempt as originally thought.
A defense ministry spokesman said Sunday that the minister's vehicle was caught
in crossfire between two groups of feuding Afghan soldiers settling a dispute
by gunfire.
Officials said Saturday that four men in military uniforms fired toward
minister Abdul Rahim Wardak's vehicle after he got out and boarded a nearby
helicopter.
Nine soldiers have been arrested in the incident.
