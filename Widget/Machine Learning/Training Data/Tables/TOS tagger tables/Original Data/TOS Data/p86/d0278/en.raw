The U.S. military said nine suspected militants have been killed in separate
operations in southern and central Afghanistan.

It said U.S.-led coalition forces killed two militants and captured six others
in a clash Thursday in the southern province of Helmand.

Separately, the military said seven militants were killed during an airstrike
that followed a gunbattle in the central province of Ghazni Wednesday.  It also
said a Taliban commander was detained.

U.S. President Barack Obama has ordered 21,000 additional troops to reinforce
the 38,000 U.S. troops already in Afghanistan, where the Taliban-led insurgency
is spreading.
