President Bush has called his Indonesian counterpart, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono,
to discuss security and trade issues.
White House spokesman Tony Snow said Monday, the two leaders talked about
United Nations Security Council efforts to confront Iran's nuclear program.
The two presidents also expressed hope for a positive outcome to talks by trade
ministers from developing countries in Jakarta later this week.
Indonesia is a new non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
