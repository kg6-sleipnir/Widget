A new movie about Arab-Americans in Los Angeles, in the era after the September
11, 2001 terrorist attacks, is putting a human face on a population that most
Americans know little about. "AmericanEast" is a comic drama highlighting the
pressures felt by Arab-Americans as they try to fit into American society and
battle negative stereotypes. Mohamed Elshinnawi has more.
