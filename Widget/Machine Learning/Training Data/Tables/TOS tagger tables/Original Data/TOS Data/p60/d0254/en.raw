President Bush is to host Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas October 20 at the
White House.
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said in a statement Friday that Mr. Bush
looks forward to discussing Palestinian efforts to improve governance, revive
the economy, institute security reform, and fight terror.
Mr. McClellan said the leaders will discuss a wide range of other bilateral and
regional issues.
The United States is making public and diplomatic appeals to Israel and the
Palestinians to end the violence that has sent regional tensions soaring only
weeks after Israel's Gaza withdrawal.
