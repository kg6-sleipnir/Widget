Authorities in Indian Kashmir say monsoon rains have caused a house to collapse
south of Srinagar, killing six members of a family. One person was rescued from
the debris.
Local officials say heavy rains also forced authorities to close the Himalayan
region's main highways, leaving thousands of motorists stranded.
Military units are on standby for flood relief operations.
Monsoon rains sweep through South Asia every year from June to September,
killing hundreds of people. They bring misery to millions of people, but are
also crucial for the farm-dependent economies.
