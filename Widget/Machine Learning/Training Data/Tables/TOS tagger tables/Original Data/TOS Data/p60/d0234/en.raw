U.S. Marines fighting in Fallujah say they have found the mutilated body of
what appears to be a Caucasian woman.
A Marine patrol found the unidentified body in a street of the violence-torn
Iraqi city.
Two Western women who also have Iraqi citizenship are known to have been
kidnapped in Iraq. Both have been missing since separate abductions last month.
They are British aid worker Margaret Hassan and Teresa Borcz, a native of
Poland.
