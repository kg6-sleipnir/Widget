Witnesses say gunmen have opened fire on the motorcade of Palestinian Prime
Minister Ismail Haniyeh.
Palestinian officials say Mr. Haniyeh was not hurt in the attack Friday in
Gaza.
The incident comes amid a power struggle between the ruling group Hamas of
Prime Minister Haniyeh and the more moderate Fatah party of Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas.
The Associated Press reported that disgruntled relatives of a Fatah activist
killed in recent fighting with Hamas were responsible for the attack.
