A Russian rights group says at least 2.5 million children in Russia are
homeless.
The chairman of the group - known as "The Children are Russia's Future" told
reporters Wednesday over 30,000 children and teenagers go missing every year in
Russia.
He also said over the past five years Russian authorities have uncovered 190
networks trafficking children.
