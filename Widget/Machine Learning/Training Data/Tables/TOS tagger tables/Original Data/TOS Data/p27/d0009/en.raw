Brad Delp was found dead March 9, at his home in the northeastern state of New
Hampshire.
The 55-year-old musician, who sang for the popular rock act Boston, was
apparently alone at the time of his death. A police investigation is ongoing.
Formed in the early 1970s, Boston remains a staple on U.S. classic rock radio
playlists. The band was reportedly planning a mid-year tour.
