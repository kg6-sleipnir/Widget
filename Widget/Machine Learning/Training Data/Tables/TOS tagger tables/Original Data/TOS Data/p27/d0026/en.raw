Iraqi police say an Italian journalist, a reporter for the Italian newspaper Il
Manifesto, has been kidnapped in Baghdad.
Unknown gunmen abducted Giuliana Sgrena Friday as she was conducting an
interview near Baghdad University.
Several Italians have been kidnapped in Iraq over the past 18 months. Two
Italian aid workers were abducted in Baghdad last September and threatened with
death before being released unharmed several weeks later.
Another Italian journalist was snatched in August and was killed after Rome
refused to yield to the kidnappers' demand that Italy withdraw its nearly 3,000
troops from Iraq.
