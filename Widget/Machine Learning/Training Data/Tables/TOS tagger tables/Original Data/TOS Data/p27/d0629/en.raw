China says a recent outbreak of avian flu in the northwestern Xinjiang region
has killed nearly 5,000 birds.
Official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported Friday that authorities killed
29,000 birds to control the outbreak in the city of Turpan.
On Thursday, a government laboratory confirmed the presence in poultry of the
deadly H5N1 strain of the virus.
Bird flu outbreaks were reported also this week in Bangladesh, Israel and
Vietnam.
The World Health Organization says the virus has killed more than 200 people
worldwide.
