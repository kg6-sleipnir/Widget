Crude oil prices rose above $96 a barrel in Tuesday's trading.
That is a rise of more than $2.
Oil traders say the rising price of oil is partly the result of the falling
value of the U.S. dollar.
The greenback hit a record low compared to the euro Tuesday.
Oil has traditionally been priced in dollars, so when the value of the dollar
falls, it puts upward pressure on the price of crude.
