The work of Cuban artists is finding an outlet in Miami, despite objections
from some Cuban Americans who believe some of the artwork portrays the
communist nation in a positive light. A small number of fledgling galleries
showcasing art from the island have appeared in the city's Little Havana
district - a hotbed of anti-Castro sentiment.
The owner of one of the galleries says she has faced criticism but continues
traveling to the island to buy paintings, photographs and sculptures to
showcase in her gallery. Steve Mort reports from Miami.
