The U.S. Air Force says it will send 300 airmen home from Iraq and Afghanistan
to help their families cope with emergencies from devastating Hurricane
Katrina.
A military spokesman said Saturday the airmen - all based at Keesler Air Base
in Biloxi, Mississippi - would begin flying home over the next two weeks. The
group includes personnel who were scheduled to rotate home in September and
others whose deployments would be cut short.
Hurricane Katrina did serious damage to Keesler Air Base, wiping out much of
its housing and infrastructure.
