An open microphone at Monday's lunch of Group of Eight leaders recorded
President Bush speaking bluntly about the situation in the Middle East.
While he thought he was talking privately with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, the microphone picked up Mr. Bush using an expletive to describe
Hezbollah's attacks on Israel.
Mr. Blair realized the microphone was on and quickly turned it off.
White House spokesman Tony Snow says Mr. Bush rolled his eyes and laughed when
he was told his private comments were recorded.
