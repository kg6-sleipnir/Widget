A powerful bomb has ripped through a section of the Philippine House of
Representatives in Manila, killing at least two people and injuring at least
nine others.
The blast occurred in the south wing of the building Tuesday evening local
time, as the House was ending its session.
Emergency crews rushed to the scene, and police have sealed off streets around
the building, in the Quezon City area.
One of those killed was a Philippine lawmaker.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing.
