The city of Fort Wayne in the midwestern state of Indiana is home to one of the
largest Burmese immigrant and refugee communities in the United States. Now,
the community is struggling to deal with the aftermath of a devastating cyclone
that has affected most of their families in Burma. VOA's Kane Farabaugh
traveled to Fort Wayne. He reports that the biggest challenge for many Burmese
in the United States is learning the fate of their loved ones.
