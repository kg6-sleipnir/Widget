A man says he was paid to throw a grenade at a mosque during Friday prayers in
Indian Kashmir, an attack that killed five people, including two young girls.
Local residents captured Ghulam Nadi Mir immediately after the attack in the
village of Tahab and turned him over to police.  He told reporters Saturday he
was paid $20 to throw the grenade. 
Police suspect the incident involved the militant group Hizb-ul-Mujahedeen, but
the group denied any involvement.
The region has been rocked by a series of grenade attacks by separatist
militants in recent months.
