Egypt is holding talks in Cairo with Palestinian militant leaders, as part of a
push to strengthen Palestinian support for a de facto ceasefire with Israel.
The talks are taking place as Egypt prepares to host an Israeli-Palestinian
summit aimed at formalizing the truce and re-starting talks on the
internationally brokered road map peace plan.
Militant sources say Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal and Islamic Jihad leader
Ramadan Shallah were both meeting Wednesday with Egyptian negotiators.
Egypt has not commented on the talks.Â
