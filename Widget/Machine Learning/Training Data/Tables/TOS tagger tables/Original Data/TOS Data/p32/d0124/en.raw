Officials in Afghanistan say a suicide car bomb attack in the southern city of
Kandahar has killed at least eight civilians and wounded at least 25 other
people.
Police say the car bomber targeted a NATO convoy passing through Kandahar.
Three coalition soldiers and two Afghan policemen were among the wounded in
Thursday's blast.
A NATO spokesman declined to give the nationalities of the soldiers.
Afghan, NATO and U.S. troops are fighting a resurgent Taliban and other rebels
who have strongholds in the southern and eastern parts of the country.
