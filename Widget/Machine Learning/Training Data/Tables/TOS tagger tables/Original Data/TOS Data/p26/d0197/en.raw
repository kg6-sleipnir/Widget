The World Health Organization estimates that at least seven and a half million
people die every year from heart disease. Women and men are equally at risk,
especially as they age. Yet most research on the effectiveness of a routine
heart procedure called cardiac catheterization has been done on men.  VOA's
Melinda Smith has more on a recent study which shows this procedure can also
benefit women.
