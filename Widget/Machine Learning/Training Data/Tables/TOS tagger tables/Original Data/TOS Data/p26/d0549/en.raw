A suspected U.S. missile strike has killed two people in Pakistan's North
Waziristan tribal region.

Pakistani intelligence officials say the strike Saturday hit a house near the
region's main town of Miran Shah.

The Pakistani government has strongly condemned the suspected U.S. strikes in
the country, saying they undermine Pakistan's counter-terrorism efforts. 

Pakistan's defense minister, Ahmed Mukhtar, says officials will meet in early
December to discuss the strikes, which allegedly are carried out by unmanned
(drone) U.S. aircraft.
