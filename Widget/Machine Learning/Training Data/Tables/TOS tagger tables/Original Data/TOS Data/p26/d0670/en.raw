Afghan police say Taliban militants attacked a police patrol in southern
Helmand province overnight Saturday, killing four officers and wounding seven
others.
The local police commander, Khair Mohammad Shuja, said the attack took place in
the Gereshk district and that his forces detained wounded Taliban at the scene
early Sunday.
News reports say two additional attacks took place in Afghanistan Sunday
resulting in more police and civilian deaths but details are still emerging
about those incidents.
