The U.S. military says it has not found the pilot of an F-16 fighter jet that
crashed in Iraq Monday.
Officials say the pilot was not at the crash site northwest of Baghdad when
U.S. ground forces arrived. The Air Force says it cannot confirm whether the
pilot is alive or dead.
Military officials say fighter aircraft spotted insurgents in the area of the
crash site immediately after the warplane went down.
Air Force officials say the cause of the crash is being investigated but that
it is unlikely the jet was shot down.
