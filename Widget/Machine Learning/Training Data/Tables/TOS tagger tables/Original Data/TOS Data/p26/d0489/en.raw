At least 30 people were killed in a theater fire that broke out Monday night in
the Egyptian town of Beni Suef, about 100 kilometers south of Cairo. At least
45 were injured.
Candles being used by performers came into contact with the stage curtains
during a play, panicking the crowd of about 1000 people who fled the theater.
Some of the victims are believed to have been trampled underfoot.
