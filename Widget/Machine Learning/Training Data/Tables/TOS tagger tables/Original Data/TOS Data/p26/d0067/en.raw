United Nations peacekeepers in Haiti say they will increase patrols to prevent
possible kidnappings when schools reopen next week.
In a statement, U.N. officials said troops and Haitian police will conduct
vehicle searches and other security measures.
A U.N. spokesman told the Associated Press that officials fear that kidnappers
may seek new victims as students return to class.
The U.N. Children's Fund has condemned recent abductions of children in and
around the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince.
Since 2004, the U.N. force in Haiti has been working to restore security and
battle impunity in the impoverished nation.
