Military officials in the Philippines say the death toll from a fuel truck
explosion in the country's south has risen to 50, with more than 40 others
injured.
The truck exploded Friday on a road in Zamoanga del Sur province, destroying
the tanker, as well as a passenger bus on the opposite side of the road.
Soldiers are still recovering bodies.
There are disagreements as to what the truck was carrying. Some reports say it
was hauling compressed carbon dioxide, while others say it was carrying
liquified petroleum gas.
