Two suspected Taleban members blew themselves up while strapping on explosives
in southern Afghanistan.
The blast occurred Thursday near a market in an Afghan town near the Pakistani
border. Afghan officials say no one else was hurt in the explosion.
The blast came a day after a roadside bomb ripped through a U.S. military
vehicle in the eastern province of Kunar, killing one soldier and wounding two
others.
Suicide attacks have increased in Afghanistan in recent months, primarily in
southern and eastern regions where U.S.-led coalition forces are hunting
Taleban and al-Qaida fighters.
