Turkey has detained 10 people with suspected links to the al-Qaida terrorist
network.
Among those arrested was a lawyer who identified himself as the leader of the
group in Turkey.
The official Anatolia news agency said Saturday the suspects were detained in
simultaneous operations begun in November in the capital, Ankara, Istanbul and
the western city of Izmir.
Turkey has suffered several attacks blamed on al-Qaida. In November 2003, more
than 60 people were killed in bombings of two synagogues, the British Consulate
and a bank office in Istanbul.
