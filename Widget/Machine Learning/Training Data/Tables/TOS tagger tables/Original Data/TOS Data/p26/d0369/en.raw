NATO peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina have raided a business owned by the
son-in-law of fugitive Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic.
Alliance officials say the raid on a photography and electronics business in
Pale run by Branislav Jovicevic was aimed at gaining additional information
about the supply network assisting Mr. Karadzic and was aimed at disrupting it.
The United Nations war crimes tribunal has indicted Mr. Karadzic for his role
in attacks on civilians during the Bosnian conflict of the 1990s. He is
believed to be hiding in Bosnia or in neighboring Montenegro.
