Diamonds, and the women who wear them, have inspired generations of jewelers
and fashion houses. And that is the theme of a new exhibition called Diamond
Divas at the Antwerp World Diamond Center in Belgium. Some 80 percent of the
world's rough diamonds are bought and sold in Antwerp. The exhibition pulls
together 76 pieces of diamond jewelry worn by the rich and famous, royalty and
Hollywood stars. Nina-Maria Potts reports.
