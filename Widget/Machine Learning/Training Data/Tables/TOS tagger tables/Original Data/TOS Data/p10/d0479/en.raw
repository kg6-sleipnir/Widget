Iraqi officials say bombs in Baghdad have wounded 15 people.

Authorities say a roadside bomb in central Baghdad's Allawi district wounded
six.  Another roadside bomb wounded four people in the Iraqi capital's western
Iskan district.

Officials say a third bomb wounded three people in the southwestern Jihad
district, and a fourth in western Baghdad's Harithiya district wounded two.

The violence comes just two days after Iraqi police said masked gunmen killed
14 people during a brazen daytime robbery at jewelry stores in the capital.
