Russian President Vladimir Putin says he believes Iran is cooperating
sufficiently with the United Nations nuclear agency and U.N. sanctions will
cause new problems.
Mr. Putin's remarks were broadcast Sunday on American television, but the
interview was conducted Friday.
The Russian leader said Iran's president told him he wanted continued
negotiations with Britain, France and Germany.Â  The three European countries,
backed by the United States, have been trying to convince Iran to suspend its
nuclear fuel enrichment program.
Russia is helping Iran build a new nuclear energy plant.
