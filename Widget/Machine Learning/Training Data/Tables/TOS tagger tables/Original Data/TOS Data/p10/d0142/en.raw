Bangladesh fire officials say a five-story building has collapsed in the
capital of Dhaka, killing at least 20 people.

Authorities said the building toppled late Tuesday, flattening surrounding
homes.

At least 25 people were injured when the building fell.  Police say it was
poorly constructed.

Rescue teams are continuing to search the rubble for bodies and survivors. 
Officials fear the death count could rise as several people are reported
missing.

Officials say many of the victims were sleeping in the surrounding homes -
- poorly constructed shanties with tin roofs -- when the building collapsed.
