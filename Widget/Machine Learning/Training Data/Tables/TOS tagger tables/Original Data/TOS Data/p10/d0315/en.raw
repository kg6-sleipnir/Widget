The French parliament has approved an anti-terrorism law that includes
increasing the use of video surveillance.
The new law permits increased video surveillance at mosques, department stores,
subways and airports. It also extends the detention period for terrorism
suspects from four to up to six days.
Civil rights groups and other critics of the measure say it will erode basic
civil liberties.
France has been on high alert since July, when Islamist suicide bombers killed
more than 50 people in attacks on the London transport system.
