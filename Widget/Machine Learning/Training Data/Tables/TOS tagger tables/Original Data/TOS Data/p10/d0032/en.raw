A new public opinions poll finds Japanese are strongly opposed to extending
their country's humanitarian mission to Iraq.
The poll published by the Mainichi newspaper Monday showed three out of four
Japanese (77 percent) are against the extension while only 18 percent support
it.
The survey also found that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's approval rating
has climbed to 56 percent, a gain of five points, since shortly before general
elections last month.
The gain came despite recent reports that the prime minister intends to extend
Japan's Iraqi mission.
