Iraqi security officials say unidentified gunmen have shot and killed the imam
of a Sunni mosque and three other people in Baghdad.

Authorities say the attackers gunned down the Sunni cleric near his home in the
western part of the city Wednesday.  Investigators say his guards were also
shot.

North of Baghdad, gunmen killed an off-duty policeman and a civilian in central
Mosul.   A woman who was nearby was wounded in the attack.

Also Wednesday, a roadside bomb wounded at least one person in the northern
Iraqi city of Kirkuk.
