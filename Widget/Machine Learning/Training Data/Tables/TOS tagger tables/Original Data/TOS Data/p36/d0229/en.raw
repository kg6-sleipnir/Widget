Bosnian Croat war crimes suspect Miroslav Bralo has pleaded not guilty to 21
counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the 1993 Muslim-Croat
fighting in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Mr. Bralo appeared before United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague to
answer such charges as murder, rape, torture, and illegal detention of
civilians.
The indictment says Mr. Bralo committed the crimes as a member of a Bosnian
Croat special unit called "The Jokers" that operated against Muslim forcers in
central Bosnia.
He voluntarily surrendered to authorities last month.
