India has suspended railway service to and from Pakistan in the wake of the
assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Officials in New Delhi did not say when the service would be restored.
Authorities are concerned that violence by angry Bhutto supporters in Pakistan
will spill across the border into India.
Militants have targeted trains in the past, including the fatal firebombing of
a Pakistan-bound train in India earlier this year. Sixty-eight people were
killed in that February attack.
