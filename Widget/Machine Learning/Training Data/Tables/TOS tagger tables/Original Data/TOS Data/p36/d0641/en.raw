A bomb blast at a police station in central Bosnia-Herzegovina has killed one
police officer and injured six others.

It is unclear whether someone threw the bomb in the town of Bugojno or it was
planted in the building.

Witnesses say the blast seriously damaged nearby buildings and destroyed parked
cars.

Police have arrested at least three suspects, but no one has yet claimed
responsibility for the attack.
