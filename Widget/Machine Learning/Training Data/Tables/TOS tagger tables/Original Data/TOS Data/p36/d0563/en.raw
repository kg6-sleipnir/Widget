Amnesty International is calling on the U.N. Security Council to impose an
immediate arms embargo on Burma for its violent crackdown on peaceful pro-
democracy demonstrators.
The London-based human rights group says a comprehensive and mandatory embargo
should remain in place until Burma's military rulers verifiably improve human
rights, including the release of all political prisoners.
Amnesty International's deputy program director for the Asia/Pacific region,
Catherine Baber, spoke to VOA's Mandy Clark about the treatment of protesters
in Burma.
