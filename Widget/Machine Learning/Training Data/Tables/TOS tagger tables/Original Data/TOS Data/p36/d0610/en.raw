A group of leading Muslim scholars has sent holiday greetings to Christians
worldwide.
In wishing a joyful and peaceful Christmas, the group also gave thanks for what
it calls the "beautiful and gracious" response to its call for more openness
between the faiths.
The group said it hopes the coming year will be one of forgiveness and where
the dignity of human life is upheld.
Pope Benedict last month accepted an invitation by the 138 Muslim scholars to
meet and talk about more cooperation between Muslims and Christians.
