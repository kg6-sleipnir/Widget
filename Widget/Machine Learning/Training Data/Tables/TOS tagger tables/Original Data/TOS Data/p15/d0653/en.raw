French police detained nine people Monday in the Paris region and nearby
Normandy in a crackdown on a group suspected of planning terror attacks in
France.
At least seven of the suspects are believed to have links to an Algerian
insurgency movement, the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, known as the GSPC,
which has declared allegiance to al-Qaida.
