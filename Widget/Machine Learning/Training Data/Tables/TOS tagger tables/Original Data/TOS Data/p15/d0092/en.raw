Police in Sri Lanka say 300 prisoners took advantage of Sunday's massive
earthquake to make their escape from a high-security jail.
Authorities say the inmates fled after a tidal wave caused by the quake
destroyed their prison, a 16th century Dutch-built fort in a southern coastal
town Matara.
Reuters news agency reports a similar prison break in Indonesia's Aceh
province. Police there say 200 prisoners fled after a tsunami destroyed the
walls of the facility.
