A leftist Colombian guerrilla leader has been killed in a clash with military
troops in the South American country.
Officials say Humberto Valbuena, a unit commander for the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, was killed Monday in the remote jungles of Caqueta
state. At least three other rebels were killed in the clash.
Colombia's long-running conflict pits FARC and a smaller leftist rebel group
against government forces and right-wing paramilitary fighters. Thousands of
people are killed annually in the conflict.
