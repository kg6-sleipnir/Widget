Sheriff's investigators have conducted a search of Michael Jackson's Neverland
Ranch in California.
California authorities filed child molestation charges against the pop music
star in December 2003. The charges involve an unidentified child under the age
of 14.
A sheriff's spokesman confirmed Friday's search, but declined to give any
further details. Jackson's Neverland Ranch is a theme-park-like estate about
160 kilometers northwest of Los Angeles.
Michael Jackson has pleaded not guilty to child molestation, conspiracy and
administering an intoxicating agent. His trial is scheduled to being January
31.
