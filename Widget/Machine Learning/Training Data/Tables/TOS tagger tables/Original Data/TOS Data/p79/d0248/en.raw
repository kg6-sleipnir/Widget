Police in Kyrgyzstan say unknown gunmen have shot dead a leading
parliamentarian in the capital, Bishkek.
Authorities named the victim as Zhirgalbek Surabaldiyev, but gave no other
details. The motive for the shooting and the identity of the attackers were not
immediately clear.
Kyrgyzstan has been wracked by political turmoil for months following a
disputed parliamentary poll in February and March that sparked protests and led
to the ousting of President Askar Akayev.
