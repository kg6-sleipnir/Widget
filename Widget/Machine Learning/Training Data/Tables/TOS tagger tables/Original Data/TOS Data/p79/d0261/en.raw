Officials in Somalia say insurgents fired mortars at a plane carrying President
Abdullahi Yusuf to neighboring Djibouti.
Hussein Mohamed, a presidential spokesman, says Mr. Yusuf was not harmed
Sunday's attack at Mogadishu airport. The spokesman said five mortar shells
landed in the airport.
The president is due to meet with a delegation of the U.N. Security Council in
Djibouti as part of its week-long trip to promote peace in Africa.
Insurgents have waged a deadly 17-month battle against Somalia's Ethiopian-
backed interim government.
