New Kids On The Block is a pop vocal group. Beginning in the 1980s, they
released several albums, two of which reached number one on the Billboard
chart. Now, after 14 years, all of the original members have reunited. Joey
McIntyre, who joined the band just before his 13th birthday, visited with VOA's
Larry London during a recent trip to Washington.
