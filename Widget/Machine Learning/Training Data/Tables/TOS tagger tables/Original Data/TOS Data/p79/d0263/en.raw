Witnesses in central Somalia say at least 17 people have died in fighting
between two rival clans.

The clashes erupted Saturday in Somalia's Mudug region, where the clans have
been in conflict over land and water rights.

Locals say more than 20 people have been wounded in the fighting.Â  Clan elders
are trying to mediate an end to the conflict.

Such clashes are not uncommon in Somalia, which has not had a stable central
government in nearly two decades.
