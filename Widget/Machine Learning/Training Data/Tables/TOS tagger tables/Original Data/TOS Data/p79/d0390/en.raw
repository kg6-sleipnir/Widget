fought for control of a crowded prison.
They say at least 13 other inmates were injured before the riot was brought
under control at Uribana prison, west of the capital Caracas.
Authorities said Tuesday the violence started early Monday when the gangs
fought for control of two cell blocks.
Riots, murders and other violence are common in Venezuela's overcrowded
prisons.
