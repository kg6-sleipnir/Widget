Kuwait's ambassador to Lebanon says a hand grenade exploded inside his
country's information office in Beirut, killing a Lebanese employee.
But Ambassador Ali Suleiman al-Seed told reporters the blast was not an act of
terrorism. He says the man was playing around with some old explosives when the
grenade went off. The Associated Press quotes the ambassador as saying the
grenade was left over from Lebanon's 1975 to 1990 civil war.
Earlier, Lebanese security officials said the blast was caused by a parcel
bomb.
