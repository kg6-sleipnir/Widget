Palestinian officials say Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia has again postponed
presenting his cabinet lineup for a vote in parliament.
Legislators had been expected to vote on the proposed cabinet Wednesday, but
Mr. Qureia again failed to rally majority support for a revised lineup that
includes more technocrats. The prime minister abandoned his original cabinet
list Monday after several legislators charged it had many corrupt officials,
and threatened to vote it down.
Palestinian officials say the vote is now rescheduled for Thursday. Mr. Qureia
must step down if he fails to get his cabinet approved.
