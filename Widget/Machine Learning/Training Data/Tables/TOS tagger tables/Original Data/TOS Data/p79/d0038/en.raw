Russia's giant Yukos oil company has filed for bankruptcy in the United States,
and has appealed for a restraining order to stop Russian authorities from
selling the company's production unit at an auction Sunday.
An Internet statement posted on the Yukos web site says the company filed for
bankruptcy Tuesday in Houston, Texas.
Yukos says the impending auction of its main oil producing subsidiary
Yuganskeneftegaz will cause immediate and irreparable harm. Russian officials
have said they want to recover at Sunday's auction billions of dollars they say
Yukos owes in back taxes.
