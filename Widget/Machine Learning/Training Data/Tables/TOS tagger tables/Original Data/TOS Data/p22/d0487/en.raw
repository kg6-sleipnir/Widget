Japan's billion dollar Kibo science laboratory has been delivered to the
International Space Station, and the astronauts have been installing and
setting it up. This week, crew members from shuttle Discovery and the space
station have also been doing a little "home repair" on the station's toilet.
Paul Sisco has a report on the week's activities in space.
