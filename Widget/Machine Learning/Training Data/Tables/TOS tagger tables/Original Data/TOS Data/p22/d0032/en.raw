At least 35,000 people have rallied in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, to
protest controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.
Shouting anti-American and anti-European slogans, the demonstrators marched
through the city to denounce the cartoons, first published in Denmark last
September.
A coalition of radical Islamic groups which opposes President Pervez
Musharraf's support for the U.S.-led war on terror organized Sunday's rally.
Hundreds of riot police closely watched the gathering but no violence was
reported.
Some protests in Pakistan have turned deadly and at least five people died in
rioting last month.
