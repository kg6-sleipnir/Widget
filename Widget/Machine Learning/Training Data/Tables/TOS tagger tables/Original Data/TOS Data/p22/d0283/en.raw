Panama and Chile have signed a free trade agreement that will eliminate nearly
all tariffs between the nations within 10 years.
Signed Tuesday, the deal aims to improve access to markets, cross-border
services and conflict resolution.Â  It also includes an environmental
cooperation pact.
Panamanian officials say the pact will also help the tiny country to build its
export industry.
