France's minister of education says the government has prepared lessons that
could be broadcast on television and radio in case schools are shut down by
outbreaks of swine flu.

The minister, Luc Chatel, announced Wednesday that the lessons were prepared by
distance learning authorities. He said that no closures are currently
scheduled, but flu-related changes will be handled on a case-by-case basis.
