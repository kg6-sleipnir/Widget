The Everglades stretch almost 200 kilometers across Florida









Wildlife has also been threatened as the glades shrink. The National Park
Service estimates that the number of wading birds has declined from a quarter
of a million in the 1930s to fewer than 20,000 today.

But you'll still see plenty of alligators. They sun themselves along the old,
two-lane state road through the Everglades, and may be diminished but are still
an awesome sight. There's nothing like them, anywhere in the world.
