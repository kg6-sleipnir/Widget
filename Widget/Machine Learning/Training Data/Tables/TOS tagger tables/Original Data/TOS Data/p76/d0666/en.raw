Nepalese police detained 41 Tibetans Sunday for illegal entry into the country.
The group was detained at the Thankot police checkpoint outside Kathmandu,
after traveling from Bhairahawa, about 280 kilometers southwest of the capital.
A government official said all of them were handed over to the immigration
department in Kathmandu Sunday afternoon.
More than 2,500 Tibetan refugees enter Nepal illegally annually in an attempt
to reach India, where the Dalai Lama's government in exile is based.
