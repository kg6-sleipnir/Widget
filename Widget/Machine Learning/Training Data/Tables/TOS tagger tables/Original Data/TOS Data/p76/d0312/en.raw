Pakistan briefly blocked two independent news channels Saturday, as they
covered the standoff between militants and soldiers at army headquarters in
Islamabad

The Geo and SAMA channels, were taken off the air for a short period of time.

The stations showed a message from Pakistan's media regulatory body saying it
is temporarily suspending transmission of "independent news TV channels" until
further notice.

Both stations have been critical of the government in the past.
