China says a wild goose found in northwestern Qinghai province has tested
positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu.
The Agriculture Ministry announced Monday that tests on Saturday confirmed the
goose died of avian influenza.
Officials say Qinghai agricultural authorities have sterilized the area where
the dead bird was found.
The bird flu virus killed more than one thousand geese in Qinghai province last
year.Â  The region is located along a major Asian migratory route for birds.
Researchers believe wild birds from the region may have carried bird flu along
migratory paths to Europe.
