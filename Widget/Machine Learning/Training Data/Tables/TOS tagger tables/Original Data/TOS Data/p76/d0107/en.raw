The United States contacted the United Nations Security Council after North
Korea test launched the missiles.
In a statement, U.N. Ambassador John Bolton said Tuesday he is urgently
consulting with other members of the 15-nation body.
Officials say that so far an emergency meeting of the security council has not
been requested. The council is expected to take up the issue on Wednesday at
its regular consultations.
