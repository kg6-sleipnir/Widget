China says it has pledged $1 million to help Iraq hold elections in January.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue says Beijing made the pledge
this week during a conference on Iraq's political future in the Egyptian resort
of Sharm El-Sheikh.
The spokeswoman said China has actively taken part in efforts to rebuild and
promote peace in Iraq and will also provide training for diplomats and for
professionals in the business management and energy sectors.
Earlier this year, China wrote off parts of Iraq's debts and pledged $25
million in reconstruction aid.
