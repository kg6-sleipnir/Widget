Thousands of motorcycle riders are in Washington for a parade known as "Rolling
Thunder," which comes a day before the Memorial Day holiday honoring U.S.
military personnel killed in battle.
The bikers are visiting the Vietnam Veterans memorial Sunday and are then
gathering at the Lincoln memorial where there will be speakers.
A musical tribute to Veterans also is to be held today, which will include pop
group Paul Revere and The Raiders and singer Nancy Sinatra.
The "Rolling Thunder" event specifically honors missing U.S. soldiers and
prisoners of war.
