Iraqi police said a suicide car bomber has killed 10 people in Kirkuk.

Police said the attacker appeared to target a group of police officers
protecting the northern city's oil infrastructure.  Officials said 22 other
people were injured in Wednesday's attack.

Tensions remain high in Kirkuk, whose status has yet to be resolved. Iraqi
Kurds, Arabs, and Turkmen lay competing claims to the oil-rich city.  

Violence has dropped across much of the country, but al-Qaida in Iraq maintains
a foothold in areas across the north.
