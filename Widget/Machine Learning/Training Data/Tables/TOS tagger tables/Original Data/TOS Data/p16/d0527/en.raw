An international development group is working to raise $2 billion in aid to
help rebuild and reform Haiti's education system.

The Inter-American Development Bank is leading a proposed five-year effort to
train teachers, improve facilities and adopt a national curriculum.

More than 4,000 schools were damaged or destroyed during the earthquake in
January that killed more than 200,000 people.

The IDB says that before the earthquake, only half of Haiti's children of
primary school age were enrolled in classes.

Haitian President Rene Preval announced the plan Saturday along with IDB
President Luis Alberto Moreno.
