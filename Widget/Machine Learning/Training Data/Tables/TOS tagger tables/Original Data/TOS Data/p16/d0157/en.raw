Last month, a United Nations conference in Rome discussed the world's rising
food prices.  The group called for trade barriers to be reduced and food export
bans to be lifted.  The cost of major food commodities has doubled over the
past two years with rice, corn and wheat at record highs.   The Philippines and
Haiti, among other countries, have been hard-hit. Some Filipino and Haitian
immigrants in the United States are sending food to their families back home. 
VOA's Deborah Block has the story.
