Burundi's army says it killed at least 17 National Liberation Forces rebel
fighters in recent clashes.
At least one soldier and a civilian also were killed in fighting that began
late Friday in a village west of the capital, Bujumbura
The government says FNL rebels were robbing the village when the army
intervened to stop them.
The FNL signed a peace agreement with the government in July 2006, but the
accord was broken about a year later.
