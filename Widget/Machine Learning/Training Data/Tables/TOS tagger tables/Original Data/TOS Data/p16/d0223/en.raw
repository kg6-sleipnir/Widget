Egyptian authorities say a construction company bus driver is in custody after
he opened fire on a busload of workers, killing six and wounding others, near
Cairo.

Egyptian construction firm Arab Contractors says Mahmoud Sweilam, a 20-year
veteran of the company, surrendered after the deadly rampage early Tuesday. Â 

Authorities say Sweilam was driving more than 20 company employees to their
work site when he suddenly stopped the bus and began shooting at them with an
automatic rifle.

Police are still investigating a motive for the attack.
