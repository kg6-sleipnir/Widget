The American fast food chain KFC is famous around the world for its fried
chicken. KFC stands for Kentucky Fried Chicken and founded by Harlan David
Sanders, better know to patrons as Colonel Sanders. 
In Kabul, Afghanistan, another KFC restaurant is doing a brisk business. But
this KFC is short for Kabul Fried Chicken and serves kabobs and pizza alongside
the chicken. 
Rahimgul Sarawan reports from Kabul that while this KFC was inspired by Colonel
Sanders, that is where the association ends. Brian Allen narrates.
