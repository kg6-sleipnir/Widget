Turkish officials say two soldiers and a government-paid village guard were
killed in a clash with Kurdish rebels.
They say the fighting erupted in Sirnak province late Saturday.
At least three other soldiers have been killed since Friday, including one who
was killed by a landmine.
The Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, has been fighting Turkey for autonomy
since 1984. The conflict has claimed more than 37,000 lives.
The group called for a ceasefire in October, but Turkey rejected it.
