The Gallup World Poll recently released details of a massive survey of more
than 50,000 Muslims, reflecting the views of more than one billion Muslims in
more than 35 countries. It is said to be the largest, most comprehensive study
of its kind.
The survey conducted during a six year period posed a series of questions
relating to Muslim views about the United States, extremism and democracy.
VOA's Mohamed Elshinnawi has the results of the poll.
