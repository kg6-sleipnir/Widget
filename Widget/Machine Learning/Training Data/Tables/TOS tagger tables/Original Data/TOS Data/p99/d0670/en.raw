Lebanon's parliament has again delayed holding a session to elect a new
president, postponing the vote for the 13th time.
Speaker Nabih Berri announced Sunday the poll, originally scheduled for Monday,
now will be held February 11.
Parliament's ruling pro-Western majority and pro-Syrian opposition factions
have agreed on an Arab League-supported plan to install army chief Michel
Suleiman as president. But the factions remain divided over a power-sharing
deal in the new government.
