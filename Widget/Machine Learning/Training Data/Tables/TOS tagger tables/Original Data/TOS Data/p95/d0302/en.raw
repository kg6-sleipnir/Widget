Pakistan's military says a roadside bomb has killed two soldiers in the
country's North Waziristan tribal region.
Four other soldiers were wounded in Thursday's attack on a military convoy in
Spinwam, near the border with Afghanistan.
Violence has escalated in North Waziristan since July, when pro-Taleban
militants abandoned a 10-month peace deal with Pakistani authorities.
The government has deployed 90,000 troops along the Afghan border to hunt down
Taleban and al-Qaida fugitives.
