Palestinian hospital sources say two Palestinian men were killed by Israeli
forces before dawn Saturday in Gaza.
The Palestinian medical workers say the two men are brothers, both in their
forties, who approached the security barrier separating Israel from Gaza. The
brothers were said to be trying to cross into Israel to find work.
The Israeli army confirmed that troops shot two men near the barrier overnight.
