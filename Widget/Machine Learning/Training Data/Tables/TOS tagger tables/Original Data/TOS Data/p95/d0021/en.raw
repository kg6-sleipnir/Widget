New York City's largest film event, the Tribeca Film Festival, is screening 120
films this year in theaters around downtown Manhattan. The 12-day festival
[which ran through May 4] was created to revive the economy in lower Manhattan
after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, and to
provide a showcase for films from abroad that might otherwise go unseen in the
U.S.  VOA's Carolyn Weaver reports.
