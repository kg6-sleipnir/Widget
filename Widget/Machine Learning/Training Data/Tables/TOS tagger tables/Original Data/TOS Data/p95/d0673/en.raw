Iraqi police say a car bomb has killed at least 13 people in Baghdad.
They say several other people were wounded in Thursday's explosion in a mostly
Shi'ite neighborhood of the Iraqi capital.
The blast comes a day after a car bombing near a Shi'ite mosque in the town of
Howaider killed 26 people.
Earlier Thursday, a roadside bomb killed an American soldier outside of
Baghdad.
