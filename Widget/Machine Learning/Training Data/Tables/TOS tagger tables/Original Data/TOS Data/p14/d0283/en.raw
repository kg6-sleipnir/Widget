The U.S. military in Afghanistan says two Marines have been wounded during an
ambush by suspected Taleban fighters north of Jalalabad.
A U.S. statement says the Marines came under fire Saturday evening while
conducting a routine security patrol, and the assailants retreated.
Both Marines received shrapnel wounds to the shoulder and were treated at the
scene before continuing with their mission.
U.S. and Afghan government troops clash regularly with insurgents in southern
and eastern Afghanistan bordering Pakistan.
Violence has declined during the winter. But Taleban officials have vowed that
attacks will intensify when the weather improves.
