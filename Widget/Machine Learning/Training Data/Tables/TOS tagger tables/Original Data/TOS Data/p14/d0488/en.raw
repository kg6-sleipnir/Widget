Reports from Afghanistan say at least three policemen died in bomb attacks
Saturday.
Officials say a roadside bomb in southern Ghazni province killed at least two
officers, destroyed a police vehicle, and wounded several other people.
A similar explosion took place in western Farah province, where one policeman
died and at least one other was wounded.
No one has claimed responsibility for either attack, but Afghan officials blame
Taliban forces.
These were the latest in a series of attacks on Afghan police, who are
sometimes seen as less well-trained than other security forces.
