Iraqi police say three bombs have exploded in a market north of Baghdad.
The bombs detonated moments apart Saturday near shops in Baquba, 65 kilometers
north of the capital, wounding at least 10 people.
Baquba is known for its religious and ethnic mix, and has been the scene of
frequent violence.
In another development today, Iraqi officials say police have detained at least
68 suspected insurgents in raids across the country.
