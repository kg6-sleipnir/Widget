The United States has confirmed that two U.S. officials met with North Korean
diplomats in New York last week.
A spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Tokyo Thursday said the working-level
meeting was used to convey U.S. policy, not to negotiate.
He did not elaborate on what the two sides discussed. But Washington has been
urging North Korea to return to six party talks on its nuclear program.
The talks have been stalled since last September, and North Korea has boycotted
efforts to arrange a new meeting.
