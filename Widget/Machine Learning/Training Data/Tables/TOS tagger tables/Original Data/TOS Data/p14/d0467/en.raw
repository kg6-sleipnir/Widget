Officials in Burma say a new outbreak of bird flu has been detected among
chickens in an eastern district near the Chinese border.
The state-run New Light of Myanmar newspaper said Saturday that the outbreak
was found at a farm in Kentung township in eastern Shan state on November 18,
after a farmer reported an unusual number of deaths in his chickens.
Officials culled an unknown number of birds at the farm.
A statement from the Myanmar Livestock and Veterinary Department urged people
to prevent the entry of poultry and birds from neighboring countries into
Burma.
