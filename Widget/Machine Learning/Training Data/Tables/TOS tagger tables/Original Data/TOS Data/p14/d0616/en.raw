Eminem and his ex-wife Kim Mathers have agreed not to publicly criticize each
other. The estranged couple say the March 26 decision arises from their desire
not to hurt their 11-year-old daughter, Hailie.
Mathers, who has twice married and divorced the 34-year-old rap star, has
frequently criticized her ex-husband's lack of compassion and fidelity.
In return, Eminem has often assailed Kim in his lyrics.
The couple wed in 1999, divorced in 2001, remarried in January 2006, and
separated three months later. Their second divorce was finalized in December.
