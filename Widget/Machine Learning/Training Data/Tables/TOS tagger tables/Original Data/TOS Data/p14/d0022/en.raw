World oil prices hit a new record in Wednesday's trading, hitting $99.29 a
barrel before easing downward.
That is 67 cents above the previous record, which was set on November 7.
Traders say the soaring prices stem from the declining value of the U.S. dollar
and worries about the supply of oil in the Northern Hemisphere as winter
approaches.
A U.S. Energy Department report Wednesday says the amount of oil available in
the United States declined slightly last week by a bit more than one million
barrels, to a total of nearly 314 million barrels.
