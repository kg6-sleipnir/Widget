Zimbabwe marks 25 years of independence from Britain Monday amid opposition
claims that the country's economy has not done well during those years.
Officials said leaders of neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania,
Namibia, Angola, Mozambique and Botswana are attending the anniversary
celebrations.
President Robert Mugabe, who has led the country since independence, is
scheduled to give a speech extolling the country's achievements.
But opposition groups are saying that the country is worse off today than when
it gained independence 25 years ago.
