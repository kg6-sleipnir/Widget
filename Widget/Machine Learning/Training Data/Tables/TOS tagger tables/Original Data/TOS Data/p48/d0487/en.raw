An artist based in Los Angeles, California, is attracting attention with a
showing of his work that combines video, audio and sculpture. Video art, or
what some call "new media art," has been around for some time.  But this
artist's work is unusual - he combines high technology and digital gadgets,
making the art interactive but as in traditional art, you could put some of the
sculptures in your home.  VOA's Paul Sisco reports on the artist, who calls
himself simply, "Matteo."
