India says it has successfully test-fired two nuclear-capable missiles.

Defense sources say the Prithvi-II missiles were fired Monday from a test range
in Chandipur in eastern Orissa state.

The missile has a range of about 220 kilometers and can carry a 500-kilogram
warhead.

Analysts say Monday's test is considered routine and unlikely to aggravate
tensions with longtime rival Pakistan.
