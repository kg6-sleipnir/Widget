Police in northwestern Pakistan say a suicide bomber detonated an explosives-
filled car at a security post Tuesday, killing a Pakistani soldier and wounding
at least seven others.

Authorities say the attack occurred in the town of Doaba in Hangu district.

Pakistan's northwestern tribal areas are considered to be Taliban and al-Qaida
militant strongholds.  

Elsewhere in the northwest, officials say two rockets landed near the runway of
Peshawar airport before dawn Tuesday.  Reports of damage varied, from slight to
none at all.
