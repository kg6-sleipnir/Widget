Pakistan's security force has arrested 10 terrorists in North Wazirstan along
the border area of Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Pakistani officials say the operation was launched Sunday after intelligence
reports indicated that several al-Qaida suspects were hiding in the mountainous
region, about 300 kilometers southwest of Islamabad.
The latest offensive comes after the Pakistani army warned local tribesman to
stop protecting terrorists, or face military action.
Last week, Pakistani soldiers killed two foreign al-Qaida members and arrested
11 in the same region.
