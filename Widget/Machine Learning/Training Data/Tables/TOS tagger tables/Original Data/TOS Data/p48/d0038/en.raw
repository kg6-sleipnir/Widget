British Prime Minister Tony Blair says it is a "complete obscenity" for
terrorists to try to justify their actions.
Mr. Blair was referring to a videotape aired Thursday of al-Qaida's second in
command, Ayman al-Zawahiri, who said Britain and the United States would face
more deaths unless they pull out of Iraq.
The prime minister charged that those responsible for the video support the
killing of innocent people in Iraq, Afghanistan and anywhere that people want
to live under the rules of democracy.Â 
The al-Zawahiri video aired on the Arab satellite channel al-Jazeera.
