Palestinian medical workers say an Israeli air strike on Gaza has killed a
Palestinian militant and wounded two other people.

Medics said Monday that the air strike hit near the border, east of Gaza City.

An Israeli army spokeswoman said the strike targeted a militant who fired a
rocket-powered grenade at Israeli soldiers near the border. The militant was
believed to have been a member of the group Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
