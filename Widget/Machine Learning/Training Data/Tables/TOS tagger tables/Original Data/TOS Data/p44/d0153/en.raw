Iraqi lawmakers say the nation's parliament voted Saturday to extend its
current session until the end of July.
The session was due to close at the end of this month.
Lawmakers are under pressure to pass key measures aimed at promoting national
reconciliation.
In a separate development, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reports that
Iraq's president will visit Tehran this week. IRNA quotes Iraqi sources who say
President Jalal Talabani is expected to meet with senior officials, including
his Iranian counterpart, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
