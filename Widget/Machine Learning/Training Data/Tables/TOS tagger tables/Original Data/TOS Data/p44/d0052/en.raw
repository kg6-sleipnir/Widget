Police in Washington briefly closed the landmark Washington Monument Friday
because of a bomb threat.
Authorities evacuated the monument and the surrounding area after the threat
was phoned in to Washington police.
An official with the National Park Police declined in a television interview to
elaborate on the threat to the 170-meter tall monument, which is a popular
tourist attraction on the National Mall near the White House.
