Mexican officials say a small plane has crashed in central Mexico state,
killing two people and destroying at least one house.
Officials say the twin-engine Aero Commander aircraft was en route from Cancun
to the city of Toluca when it went down late Friday in a residential area a few
kilometers from of the runway.
Emergency crews say two people from the plane were killed and a third was
injured. No injuries on the ground have been reported.
Officials have yet to say what may have caused the accident.
