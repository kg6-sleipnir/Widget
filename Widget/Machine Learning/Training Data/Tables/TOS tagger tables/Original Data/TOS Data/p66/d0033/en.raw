Authorities in Haiti say gunmen shot and killed two police officers and a
civilian Monday in an apparent ambush in Port-au-Prince.
Police say gunman attacked the car the officers and civilian were driving in.
The shooting follows several weeks of attacks that officials say are aimed at
destabilizing the country ahead of elections scheduled for later this year.
The United Nations mission and Haitian police have struggled to restore order
to Haiti for more than a year, after an armed uprising ousted President Jean-
Bertrand Aristide.
