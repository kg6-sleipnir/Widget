Ukrainian President Victor Yushchenko says his nation is obliged to prevent
crimes against humanity.
President Yushchenko told the United Nations General Assembly Thursday that
Ukraine lost 10 million lives during the era of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
He said he wanted the world to be aware of such brutality.
Mr. Yushchenko said Ukraine is an active member in the fight against terrorism
and is committed to controlling nuclear proliferation.
He said the country has developed what he called a road map to bring Ukraine
closer to a united Europe and integration into the international economy.
