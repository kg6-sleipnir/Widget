Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos has called on the United Nations to move
from rhetoric to action when helping developing nations.
Mr. Papadopoulos told the U.N. General Assembly Thursday that the gap between
what he calls the haves and the have-nots is widening dramatically.
He said the world body must honor past commitments and work to achieve goals
for debt relief, improving access to world markets, and fighting AIDS and other
diseases.
Mr. Papadopoulos said detecting the seeds of conflict early and preventing them
from blowing up into war should be the cornerstone of U.N. collective security
efforts.
