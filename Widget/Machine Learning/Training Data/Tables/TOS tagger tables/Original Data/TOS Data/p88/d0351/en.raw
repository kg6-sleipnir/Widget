And it has nothing to do with their lovely lawns









Ten years ago at the University of California-Berkeley, just 40 students
enrolled in an introductory class on the subject of energy.  This year, 270
students are taking the class.
There are energy CLUBS on campus. The one at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology has 1,700 members. And at Arizona State University, 600 students
have declared sustainability as their major.  

Not long ago, even top college students would likely have had trouble
definingsustainability.  Now, a lot of them are specializing in it.
