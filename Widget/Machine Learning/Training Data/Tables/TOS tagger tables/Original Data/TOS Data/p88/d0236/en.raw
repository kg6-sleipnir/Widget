Authorities in Brazil say four people from the same family have died in a
mudslide in Sao Paulo state.

Officials say the four, including two girls, died when a mudslide triggered by
heavy rains caused their house to collapse.

The incident occurred in the city of Jundiai.

The neighboring state of Minas Gerais has been hit hard by heavy flooding and
mudslides. More than 13,000 people there have been forced to leave their homes.
