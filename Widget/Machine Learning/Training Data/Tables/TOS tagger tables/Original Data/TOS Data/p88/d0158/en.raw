Iraqi police in the northern town of Mosul say gunmen have killed a cameraman
working for the Associated Press.
Police say Aswan Lutfalla was having his car repaired when a firefight broke
out nearby.Â  He went to film the clash and was apparently deliberately shot by
gunmen.
Lutfalla is the second AP Television News cameraman to be killed in Mosul in
the last two years.
Last week, a U.S. press advocacy group, The Committee to Protect Journalists,
said 89 journalists have been killed in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in
March 2003.
