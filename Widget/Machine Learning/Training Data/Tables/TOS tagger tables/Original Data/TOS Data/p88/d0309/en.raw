A Russian contractor for the United Nations and an Indian businessman are the
latest kidnap victims in Haiti's recent rash of ransom abductions.
Officials said Thursday the men were snatched in separate incidents this week
in Haiti's capital and kidnappers later demanded ransoms for their release.
Haiti has experienced a surge in ransom kidnappings in recent weeks, sparking
concern from local business leaders who worry about continuing lawlessness.
The Associated Press reports that the U.N. estimates some 130 people, mostly
affluent businessmen, were kidnapped last month alone in Port-au-Prince.
