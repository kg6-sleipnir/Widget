Russia's foreign minister says halting aid to the Hamas-led Palestinian
government is a mistake.
Sergei Lavrov's comments Tuesday in Moscow came just days after the United
States and the European Union suspended direct aid to the Palestinian
government.
Lavrov said the funding cut-off will only serve to further destabilize the
region. He said the only way to ensure that Hamas meets Western demands is to
engage the Hamas leadership.
The U.S. and EU are demanding that Hamas renounce terrorism and recognize
Israel's right to exist.
