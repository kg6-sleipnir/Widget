Russia's foreign minister says Iraq could split into different states if its
ethnic groups fail to unite.
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned Tuesday in St. Petersburg that Iraq could
break up if the government in Baghdad does not take urgent steps toward
achieving real national unity.
Russia opposed the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and has called for efforts
to contain the violence there.
