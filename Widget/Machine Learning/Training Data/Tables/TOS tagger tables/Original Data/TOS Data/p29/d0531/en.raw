The Spanish government says police have seized three tons of cocaine from a
cargo ship off the Canary Islands and arrested 16 people.
Police boarded the Panamanian-flagged cargo ship Thursday. The raid was the
culmination of an investigation that lasted over a year.
The vessel's entire ten-man crew was taken into custody, as were six other
people in the Canary Islands and Madrid.
