Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has reshuffled his cabinet.
Mr. Chavez announced late Saturday that Ali Rodriguez, who heads the state-run
oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, would replace Jesus Perez as foreign
minister.
Oil minister Rafael Ramirez will take over the state-run oil company, while
also retaining his government oil portfolio.
The high-profile changes had been widely expected and come after Mr. Chavez
consolidated his political power with a victory in an August 15 referendum on
his government.
