Suspected militants in Pakistan have blown up 36 oil tankers that supply fuel
to U.S.-led forces in neighboring Afghanistan.
Pakistani officials Monday said the attackers set off two bombs near the
trucks, triggering fires and explosions Sunday night in the Khyber tribal
district. At least 70 people were wounded.
More than 80 oil tankers bound for Afghanistan were parked in the area when the
explosion happened.
No one has claimed responsibility.
