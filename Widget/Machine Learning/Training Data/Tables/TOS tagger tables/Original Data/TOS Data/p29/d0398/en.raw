Iraqi medical officials said Saturday the death toll from a suicide bombing at
a cafe northeast of Baghdad had risen to at least 26.

The blast took place late Friday in the town of Balad Ruz, in Diyala province. 
The town is located in a predominately Kurdish Shi'ite region, about halfway
between the city of Baquba and the Iranian border.

An Iraqi police official says the bomber detonated an explosives-filled belt
inside a popular cafe.  At least 45 people were wounded.
