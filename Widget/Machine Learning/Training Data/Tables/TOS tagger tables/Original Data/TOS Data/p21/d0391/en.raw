Military forces of two Burmese ethnic groups engaged in intense fighting along
the border with Thailand earlier this week.
Sources say the fighting broke out Tuesday between forces aligned with the Wa
and Shan groups near Thailand's northern Mae Hong Son province. The battle
began after talks to resolve several issues broke down, including a dispute
over water use.
There is also speculation that illegal drugs also played a part in the
fighting.
Thailand has increased security along the Burmese border to keep the violence
from spilling over into its territories.
