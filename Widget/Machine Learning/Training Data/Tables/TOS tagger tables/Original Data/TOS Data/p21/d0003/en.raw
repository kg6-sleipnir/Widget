Kidnappers in Haiti have released a group of children they abducted from a
school bus early Thursday.
Police said Friday the kidnappers freed the children unharmed later Thursday. 
Local media report the abductors were paid an unspecified ransom.  But the
Associated Press quotes a police commissioner as denying any ransom was paid.
Police also said they are working to secure the release of an American
missionary kidnapped Thursday in a separate incident.
Neither case was considered to be politically motivated.
