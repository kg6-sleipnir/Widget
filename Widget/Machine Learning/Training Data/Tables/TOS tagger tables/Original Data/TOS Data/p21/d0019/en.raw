A British judge has dropped charges against seven soldiers accused of beating
an Iraqi teenager to death in 2003.
The judge ruled Thursday there was not enough evidence against the soldiers.
They had faced a court-martial in connection with the death of 18-year-old
Nadhem Abdullah during a skirmish in southern Iraq.
