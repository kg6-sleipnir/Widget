Police in Pakistan say they have arrested six Islamic militants who belong to a
group accused of attacks on the country's Shi'ite minority.
Police say the militants belong to the banned Lashkar-e-Jhangvi group, which
has alleged links to al-Qaida.
They made the arrests during a raid on the group's base in Multan, in central
Pakistan.
Officials say the group is responsible for suicide bombings on Shi'ite
religious sites and may have been planning new attacks.
Police have arrested several other members of the group recently.
