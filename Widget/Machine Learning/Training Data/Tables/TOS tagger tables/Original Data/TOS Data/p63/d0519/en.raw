A pro-reformist Web site says Iran has barred former President Mohammad Khatami
from leaving the country.

The Web site Parlemannews says Mr. Khatami was scheduled to depart Thursday
night to attend a nuclear disarmament conference in Japan.

There was no immediate reaction from the Iranian government.

Mr. Khatami was a key supporter of defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein
Mousavi in June elections.  Opposition leaders claim that President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad stole the vote.  The Iranian government has carried out violent
crackdowns on anti-government protests staged since the presidential election.
