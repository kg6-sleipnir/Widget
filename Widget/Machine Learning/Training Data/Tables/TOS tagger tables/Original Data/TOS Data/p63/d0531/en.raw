Authorities in Azerbaijan have inaugurated a NATO-funded project for
reprocessing surplus rocket fuel dating back to Soviet times.
The project is being launched in Alyaty. It involves the conversion of about
1,500 metric tons of fuel known as melange into fertilizer. Warsaw Pact forces
formerly used the fuel. It is considered hazardous to the environment.
The $2-million program will deal with fuel stored at two locations in
Azerbaijan
