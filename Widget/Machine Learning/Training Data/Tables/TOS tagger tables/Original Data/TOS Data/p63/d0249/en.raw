The office of the Israeli prime minister says a visit to Israel by the foreign
ministers of Egypt and Jordan will take place July 25, not this week as
previously planned.
Ehud Olmert's office gave no reason for the postponement.
The Egyptian and Jordanian ministers are making the trip on behalf of the 22-
nation Arab League to discuss reviving an Arab peace initiative with Mr.
Olmert.
The initiative includes offering Israel normal relations with all Arab
countries in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from all lands captured during
the 1967 war.
