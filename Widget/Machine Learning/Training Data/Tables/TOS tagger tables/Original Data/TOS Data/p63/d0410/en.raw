A crowd in Bangladesh has beaten eight pirates to death after they boarded a
river boat and tried to rob passengers.
Authorities say at least a dozen pirates boarded the ferry on the Jamuna river,
northwest of the capital, Dhaka.
But police on the ferry challenged the bandits, and passengers chased them when
they jumped overboard to flee.  Several pirates escaped, but the others were
caught and beaten.  Eight died from their injuries.
