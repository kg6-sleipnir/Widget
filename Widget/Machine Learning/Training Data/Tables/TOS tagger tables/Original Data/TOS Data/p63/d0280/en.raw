U.S.-led coalition forces clashed Sunday with Taleban militants in the
country's southern Helmand province.
Military officials say at least 10 insurgents were killed when coalition air
strikes hit militant positions during an early morning operation in the Garmser
district.
Coalition and Afghan forces have been fighting Taleban insurgents since 2001,
when a U.S.-led invasion drove the Islamic group from power.
Militant attacks in southern and eastern Afghanistan have escalated over the
past 19 months, marking the bloodiest period since the beginning of the war.
