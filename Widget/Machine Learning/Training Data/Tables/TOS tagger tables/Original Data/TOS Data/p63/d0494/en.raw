Democratic Republic of Congo troops who are apparently upset over a pay dispute
fired on a United Nations base in the country's eastern region.

U.N. officials say 27 soldiers have been arrested for allegedly firing on a
U.N. peacekeepers' base in North Kivu province.

No casualties were reported.

United Nations officials say the Congolese troops are upset because they have
not been paid for several months.
