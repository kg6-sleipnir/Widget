A U.S. military officer has been charged with stealing nearly $700,000 of funds
intended for humanitarian relief in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Captain Michael Dung Nguyen is accused of stealing the money while on duty in
Iraq, from April 2007 until last month.

Nguyen was arrested after the U.S. Internal Revenue Service tracked large
deposits made by Nguyen in U.S. banks.

The army captain is charged with theft of government property, money laundering
and illegally structuring financial transactions.
