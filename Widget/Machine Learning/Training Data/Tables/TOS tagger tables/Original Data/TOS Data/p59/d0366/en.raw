The Ukrainian parliament has ousted the government of Prime Minister Yulia
Tymoshenko in a no-confidence vote.

A majority of 243 lawmakers in the 450-member chamber on Wednesday approved the
no-confidence measure brought by the party of Regions led by newly-elected
President Viktor Yanukovych.

Mr. Yanukovych defeated Ms. Tymoshenko in a presidential runoff election last
month.

Under Ukraine's constitution, the Tymoshenko government is automatically
required to resign, although it can stay on as a caretaker until a new
government is appointed.

Ms. Tymoshenko earlier indicated she would resign immediately, if the no-
confidence measure was approved.
