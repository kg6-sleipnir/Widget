Hospital officials in Israel say the condition of comatose former Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon has deteriorated further.
A statement issued Monday from the Tel Aviv hospital where Mr. Sharon is being
treated says the former prime minister has a new chest infection and his urine
output has decreased significantly.
The 78-year-old Mr. Sharon has been unconscious since early January when he
suffered a massive stroke.
