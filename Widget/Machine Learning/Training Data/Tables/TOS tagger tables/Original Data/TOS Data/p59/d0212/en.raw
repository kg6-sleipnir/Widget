Police in Israel have charged an Iranian-born Israeli with passing defense
information to Iran.
Media reports say the man is believed to have had contact with Iranian
intelligence agents in Istanbul and given them the names of people serving in
the Israeli security and intelligence services.
Police officials say the suspect was arrested earlier this month and formally
charged in Tel Aviv Sunday. The suspect's identity has not been released.
