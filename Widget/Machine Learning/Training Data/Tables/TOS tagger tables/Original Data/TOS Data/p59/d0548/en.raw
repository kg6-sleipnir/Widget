Afghan and NATO forces have killed 20 Taleban militants during fighting in
southern Afghanistan.
A local police chief says the clash occurred late Wednesday in the Shah Wali
Kot district of Kandahar province.
The police chief says three of the 20 Taleban fighters' bodies were found.
Authorities say there were no injuries among Afghan or NATO forces.
Militant attacks have soared in recent months in Afghanistan. More than 3,000
people have been killed this year as Afghan, NATO and U.S. forces battle
Taleban fighters.
