The European Union has welcomed Sunday's publication of Iraq's draft
constitution.
The EU presidency, held currently by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, issued
a statement calling the document an "important milestone" in Iraq's political
process.
The EU statement urged all Iraqi's to participate in the ratification vote
scheduled for October.
It also offered EU help in preparing for that vote and for national elections
scheduled for December.
