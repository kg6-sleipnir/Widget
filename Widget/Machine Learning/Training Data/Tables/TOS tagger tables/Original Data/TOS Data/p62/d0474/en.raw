British Foreign Secretary David Miliband is in Pakistan for talks with
government leaders.
Officials say Miliband traveled Sunday to the northwestern city of Peshawar,
capital of the volatile North West Frontier Province.
The British official is expected to meet with the provincial governor and other
local officials to discuss security issues and ongoing cooperation.
Earlier this month, British Interior Minister Jacqui Smith said Britain is
ready to increase its assistance to Pakistan to combat militancy.
Pakistan is a key Western ally and has helped the United States and Britain
thwart terrorist attacks.
