Pope Benedict XVI says he does not feel well enough to take many foreign trips,
but said he he hopes to travel to what he calls a peaceful Holy Land.
In an interview with German television broadcast Sunday, Pope Benedict said the
Vatican wants to mobilize all forces who he says recognize that war is the
worst solution for all sides, even for those he calls the apparent victors.
Earlier Sunday, the pope voiced hope for the ceasefire in Lebanon and is urging
the quick delivery of humanitarian aid once the truce takes hold.
