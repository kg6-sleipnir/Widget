Japan Airlines says it will purchase 30 Boeing 7E7 Dreamliner aircraft, with an
option to buy 20 more.
The price of the deal was not disclosed, but could be around $4 billion. Japan
Airlines is expected to receive its first Boeing Dreamliner in 2008. Boeing and
European rival Airbus were competing for the Japan Airlines deal. Boeing and
Airbus have been battling in recent months to win contracts with Asian
airliners.
Boeing recently reached a deal with Japan's All Nippon Airways, while Airbus
inked a contract with Malaysia's AirAsia.
