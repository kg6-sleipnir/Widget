Iran has warned the European Union that Tehran will never surrender its right
to nuclear fuel.
A spokesman for Iran's Supreme National Security Council said Saturday EU
negotiators can offer no incentive that would compel the Islamic republic to
abandon its nuclear program.
Britain, France and Germany have asked Tehran to surrender its fuel-making
program in return for economic incentives.
Tehran insists it has every right to enrich uranium for reactors to make
electricity. 
The United States accuses Iran of secretly developing nuclear weapons.  Tehran
says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes.
