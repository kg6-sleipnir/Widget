Egypt's culture minister says police have recovered the Vincent van Gogh
painting that was stolen from a Cairo museum earlier Saturday.

Farouk Hosni said security officials at the Cairo airport have arrested two
Italian nationals who were trying to leave the country with the painting.

The painting by the Dutch artist is valued at about $50 million. It goes by two
titles, Poppy Flowers and Vase with Flowers.
