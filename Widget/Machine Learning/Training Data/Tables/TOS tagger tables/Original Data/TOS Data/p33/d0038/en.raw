Afghan officials say at least eight police have been killed following an ambush
by suspected Taleban rebels in southeastern Afghanistan.
Security officials say four Taleban insurgents were also killed in the attack
Friday in Helmand province. No other details were immediately available.
An interior ministry spokesman said captured Taleban insurgents led police
there to look for a large Taleban hideout.
