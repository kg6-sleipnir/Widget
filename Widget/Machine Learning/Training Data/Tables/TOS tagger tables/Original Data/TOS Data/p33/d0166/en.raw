Ecuador's constituent assembly has approved a new draft constitution that will
be put to a referendum in September.

The new charter approved late Thursday would grant President Rafael Correa
broad powers, including functions currently held by the Central Bank.Â  It would
also modify term limits, allowing him to seek re-election.

President Correa has said the constitution should be changed to limit the power
of Ecuador's major political parties.

However opposition members say the real reason for the change of constitution
is to keep the leftist president in power and increase his control of the
country.
