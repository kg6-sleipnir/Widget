Witnesses say three British citizens have been kidnapped by gunmen in the
southern Gaza Strip, after crossing into the territory from Egypt.
Security officials in Gaza say one of the victims is a human rights worker.
There was no claim of responsibility, and Palestinian authorities say they have
begun a search.
Recent kidnappings in Gaza have ended peacefully with the hostages released
unharmed. In several cases, the kidnappers were either seeking jobs with the
Palestinian Authority, or the release of imprisoned relatives.
