The Asian Development Bank has issued a $2.7-million grant to Afghanistan to
improve the country's road system in rural areas.
The grant will go to training highway engineers at Kabul Polytechnic University
as well as to the Ministry of Public Works.
The ADB said on Tuesday that the purpose of the grants is to help people in
Afghanistan's backcountry gain better access to the center of the country.
The grants will be applied to a road master plan that was earlier developed
with ADB assistance.
