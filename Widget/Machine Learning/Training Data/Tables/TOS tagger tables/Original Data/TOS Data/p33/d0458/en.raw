Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has ordered officials in southern China to brace for
Typhoon Damrey.
He says authorities must make preparations for the typhoon, which is expected
to make landfall late Sunday or early Monday and pound the region with heavy
rains and strong winds.
Earlier this month, Typhoon Khanun killed at least 14 people in coastal
provinces of eastern China. And Typhoon Talim killed at least 42 people when it
hit Zhejiang province.
