Bosnia Herzegovina's war crimes court has confirmed charges against three
Bosnian Croats accused of war crimes against Muslim civilians during the Balkan
conflict.
In an official statement released Monday, the court confirmed charges against
the three former Bosnian Croat soldiers.
Court officials say the soldiers are responsible for planning and ordering the
murder, rape and torture of Muslims in the southern city of Mostar in the early
1990s.
