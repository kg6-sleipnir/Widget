Thailand's military-backed interim prime minister Surayud Chulanont is in
Indonesia to meet with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.
Mr. Surayud's visit Saturday is the latest in a flurry of introductory
diplomatic trips to Thailand's neighbors following last month's coup.
The Thai interim prime minister has visited Malaysia, Laos and Cambodia and is
scheduled to meet leaders in the Philippines and Vietnam next week.
Mr. Surayud, a former army general, was appointed by a Thai military council
that ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in September.
