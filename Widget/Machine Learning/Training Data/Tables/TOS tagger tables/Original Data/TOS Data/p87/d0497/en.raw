German and Polish police have arrested 10 people in a cross-border operation
targeting suspected smugglers of steroids.
German police say more than 200 officers took part in raids in more than 50
buildings in cities in Germany and in the Polish port city of Gdansk.
Police say the steroids had been distributed among body builders and insist
that there was no indication the drugs were to be used by participants in other
sports.
