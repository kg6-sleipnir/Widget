Anti-Bush demonstration in the center of Amsterdam
Around 1,000 people, protesting the U.S.-led war in Iraq, have demonstrated in
Amsterdam ahead of President Bush's arrival in the Netherlands.
The protesters gathered on Museum Square outside the U.S. consulate carrying
signs with slogans criticizing Mr. Bush's Iraq policy.
Meanwhile, as many as 100 others demonstrated in Maastricht in the southern
Netherlands, where Mr. Bush arrived Saturday evening. He plans to attend a
ceremony Sunday at the American Cemetery in Margraten to mark the 60th
anniversary of the end of World War II.
