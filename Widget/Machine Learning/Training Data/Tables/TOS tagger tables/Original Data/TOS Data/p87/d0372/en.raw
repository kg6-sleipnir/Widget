New York City, among the most aggressive U.S. municipalities in pursuing new
public health regulations, is doing it again. In 2003, the City banned smoking
indoors.  Last year, it prohibited restaurants from using trans fats in food. 
Now, New York is requiring many restaurants to publish and post the calorie
content of their foods, to help combat a growing "obesity epidemic." City
officials say this is their way to fight the obesity epidemic and other U.S.
cities are following the lead.  VOA's Paige Kollock reports from New York.
