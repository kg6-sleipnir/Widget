The U.S. military says an American soldier has been charged with killing two
other U.S. servicemen in the Iraqi city of Fallujah.

In a statement released Wednesday, the military said Neftaly Platero has also
been charged with one count of attempted murder.

He is accused of shooting three soldiers after an argument last month.

The military says the shootings were premeditated, and that it is continuing to
investigate the incident.

Platero will be tried in a military court.
