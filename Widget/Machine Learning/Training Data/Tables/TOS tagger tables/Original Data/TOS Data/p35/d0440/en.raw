South Koreans are now counting the days to their country's historic first
astronaut in space, set to launch aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket on 8 April.
The mission is full of landmarks: it will be the first time a South Korean
woman has headed into orbit, and it will also be the first time that "kimchi" -
that spicy, garlicky cabbage dish that epitomizes South Korea - will be served
at the zero-gravity dinner table.VOA Seoul Correspondent Kurt Achin headed to
the high-tech kitchen where kimchi was getting a pre-launch makeover.
