President Bush says U.S. and Iraqi forces have delivered justice to the most
wanted terrorist in Iraq - Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.
Mr. Bush said at the White House that Zarqawi will never murder again, and that
his death is a severe blow to al-Qaida.
The president said Zarqawi personally led a campaign of beheadings, killings,
and suicide attacks.
However, Mr. Bush warned that the terrorists will try to continue without
Zarqawi, and vowed that the U.S. mission in Iraq will continue.
