A strong earthquake that rattled southeastern Turkey Monday has injured at
least 37 people while causing minor damage to buildings.
The Kandill Observatory in Istanbul says a preliminary estimate of the quake's
magnitude was 5.7. It was centered near the town of Karliova in Bingol
province.
Turkish officials have sent rescue teams, tents and blankets to the area.
Earthquakes are frequent in Turkey, which sits atop a major tectonic faultline.
A powerful quake that hit northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000
people.
