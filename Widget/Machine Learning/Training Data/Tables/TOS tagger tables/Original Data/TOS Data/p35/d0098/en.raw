Authorities in northwestern Pakistan say a minibus - hit by falling rock - has
plunged into a ravine, killing 15 people. Four others survived with injuries.
The authorities say the driver to lost control of the bus Sunday on the road to
Mansehra from Balakot, a town devastated by last year's earthquake.
Landslides are common in the mountainous region, where the October 8 quake last
year killed more than 73,000 people.
