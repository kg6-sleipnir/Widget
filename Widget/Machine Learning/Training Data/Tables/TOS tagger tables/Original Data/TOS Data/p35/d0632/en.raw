Heavy rains in Brazil have caused deadly mudslides that have killed at least
seven people, mostly children.
Authorities say the victims lived in a shantytown in the industrial suburb of
Sao Bernardo do Campo, near the city of Sao Paulo.
Torrential rains have lashed the Sao Paulo region since Tuesday.
