officials are searching for survivors in a turbulent river from a ferry that
capsized and killed at least 20 people.
Officials say more than 100 people were on the ferry when it overturned
Saturday in a river in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal.
Officials say about 50 passengers have been rescued and sent to the hospital.
Dozens of others were missing.
Authorities say the boat's maximum capacity was 60 people, but it was badly
overloaded.
Officials say most of the passengers were Muslims returning to the town of
Kakdwip after attending a religious festival.
