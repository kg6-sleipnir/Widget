Taiwan has asked internet search company Google to stop calling it a province
of China on its maps.
A Taiwan foreign ministry spokesman said Tuesday that the ministry has asked
Google to correct the description.
Taiwan says it is a sovereign, independent state officially called the Republic
of China.
China views Taiwan as a breakaway province and has threatened to attack the
island if it pushes for formal statehood. The two split in a civil war that
ended in 1949.
