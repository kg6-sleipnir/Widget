 Two powerful explosions have ripped apart a vehicle belonging to a prominent
Venezuela prosecutor.
Witnesses say the two blasts destroyed Deputy Attorney General Danilo
Anderson's truck as it drove through a neighborhood in western Caracas late
Thursday.
Venezuelan officials say investigators are trying to determine if the charred
body found inside the vehicle is Mr. Anderson.
Mr. Anderson was preparing a case against nearly 400 people allegedly involved
in the April 2002 rebellion that briefly ousted populist president Hugo Chavez.
