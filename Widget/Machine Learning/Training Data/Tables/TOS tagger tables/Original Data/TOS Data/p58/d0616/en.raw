Rival clans in southern Somalia have clashed in a fight for control over a
trading town, and witnesses report dozens of deaths and injuries.
Residents say more than 20 people were killed and 30 injured in the battle that
began late Friday night in a town identified by Reuters news agency as Ceel
Waaq near the Kenyan border.
The town is described as a center of commercial activity.
Warlords have ruled Somalia since dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in
1991.
