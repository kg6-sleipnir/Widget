The Afghan government and the United Nations refugee agency have pledged to
strengthen efforts to resettle returnees and people inside the country
displaced by violence.  The pledge came after a high-profile visit to the
country this week by the head of U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Antonio
Guterres.  As VOA's Ravi Khanna reports, the U.N. official wants the
international community to do more to resettle Afghan refugees.
