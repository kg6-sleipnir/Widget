Afghan officials say 10 Taliban militants have been arrested for an acid attack
on schoolgirls and teachers in southern Afghanistan.

Officials say militants on motorbikes attacked the girls and teachers as they
walked to school in the southern city of Kandahar earlier this month.

Several girls suffered facial burns and were hospitalized.

A Taliban spokesman earlier denied responsibility for the attack.

Under Taliban rule, girls were banned from school and were only allowed to
leave the house accompanied by a male relative.

The Afghan government has accused Taliban militants of attacking dozens of
schools and teachers.
