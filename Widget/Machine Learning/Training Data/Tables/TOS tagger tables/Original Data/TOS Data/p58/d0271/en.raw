U.S. and Brazilian media reports say police have arrested a key al-Qaida
operative in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo.

The arrest was reported Tuesday by the Associated Press (AP) and Brazil's daily
newspaper, Folha de S. Paulo.

The suspect was not identified by name, nor was his nationality given.  But the
AP said a federal police spokeswoman confirmed the newspaper's report that the
suspect is a top player in al-Qaida's international communications.

She said the suspect is being held under laws that prohibit the promotion of
racism in Brazil.
