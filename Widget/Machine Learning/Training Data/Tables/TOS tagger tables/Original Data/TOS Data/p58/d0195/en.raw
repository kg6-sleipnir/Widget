Israeli doctors say Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who remains in a coma since
suffering a stroke two weeks ago, underwent a surgical procedure overnight to
replace his breathing tube.
The Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem issued a statement Wednesday morning, saying
the procedure was necessary because the respiratory pipe developed a technical
problem.
The statement said Mr. Sharon's condition continues to be critical but stable.
The 77-year-old prime minister has been on respirator since he was
incapacitated by a brain hemorrhage on January 4.
