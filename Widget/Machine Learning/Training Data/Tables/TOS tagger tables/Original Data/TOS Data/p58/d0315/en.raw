Police in Iran say a fire at a mosque in central Tehran has killed at least 59
people and injured more than 200 others.
Iranian state media said a faulty electrical heater sparked the blaze as crowds
gathered in the Arg Mosque for a major Shi'ite religious festival, Ashura.
Eyewitnesses said panicked crowds rushed for the exits and some people jumped
through windows to escape the flames.
