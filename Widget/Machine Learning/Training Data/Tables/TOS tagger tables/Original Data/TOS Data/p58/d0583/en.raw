The U.S. military says coalition troops in Afghanistan killed 10 militants
linked to al-Qaida, including foreign fighters.

A military statement says the attack took place Saturday in eastern Afghanistan
during an operation against a militant network known to carry out bomb attacks.

The statement says the network is run Afghan militant leader Jalaluddin
Haqqani, who authorities believe operates out of neighboring Pakistan.

The U.S. alleges the Haqqani network has ties to al-Qaida and Pakistani
intelligence agents.Â
