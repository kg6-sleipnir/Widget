Competitive diving is one of the sports guaranteed to attract a large audience
at the Summer Olympics in Beijing.

  Recreational diving is also a growing amateur sport in the U.S. 
Unfortunately, the joy of jumping off the diving board at the local swimming
pool has too often been spoiled by a trip to the emergency room. VOA's Melinda
Smith has details of a new study showing that at least 6,000 children in the
U.S. are hurt every year in diving accidents.
