Ukrainian lawmakers have set Tuesday for a repeat vote on Yulia Tymoshenko's
nomination as prime minster.
Members of the unicameral parliament Verkhovna Rada also agreed Friday to vote
by raising hands to ensure transparency.
Ms. Tymoshenko failed to win the absolute majority by one vote Tuesday.
Ms. Tymoshenko accused her political rivals of tampering with the electronic
voting system, saying the device failed to register two votes cast in her
favor.
The vote will follow President Viktor Yushchenko's decision Wednesday to again
nominate her for the post.
