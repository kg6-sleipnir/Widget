Venezuelan authorities say a new outbreak of fighting among inmates at a
crowded prison has left six more prisoners dead.
Earlier this week, 16 prisoners were killed at Uribana prison when rival gangs
fought for control of two cell blocks. National guard troops were called to
maintain order at the prison, located west of the capital, Caracas.
Riots, murders and other violence are common in Venezuela's overcrowded
prisons.
