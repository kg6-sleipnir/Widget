A powerful earthquake has shaken the area around Tibet in China.

The U.S. Geological Survey says the quake had a 6.9 magnitude and was centered
about 245 kilometers north of Qamdo prefecture, which borders China's Sichuan
province.

At least one strong aftershock with a 5.2 magnitude struck about 30 minutes
later.

There were no early reports about damage or injuries. Â 

A massive 7.9 quake hit Sichuan province in 2008, killing close to 90,000
people.
