President Bush has signed legislation reaffirming U.S. support for the
continued expansion of NATO.
The measure designates Albania, Croatia, Georgia, Macedonia and Ukraine as
eligible to receive financial assistance as they pursue NATO membership.
It also specifies that funds for military assistance for these countries should
be included in next year's budget. But the White House announcement did not
specify a figure.
