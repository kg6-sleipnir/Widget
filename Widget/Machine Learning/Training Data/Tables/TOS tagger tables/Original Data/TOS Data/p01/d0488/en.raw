The Who cancelled a March 13 concert in Tampa, Florida, after lead singer Roger
Daltrey fell ill.
The 63-year-old Daltrey walked offstage during the first song; guitarist Pete
Townshend later told the crowd he was suffering from bronchitis and could
barely speak.
The crowd of 9,000 then cheered when Townshend said the show had been
rescheduled for March 25.
The Who is currently touring in support of Endless Wire, its first album since
1982. The band next performs March 17 in Mexico City.
