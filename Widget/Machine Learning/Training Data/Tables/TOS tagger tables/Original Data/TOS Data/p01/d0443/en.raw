Venezuela's defense minister says his country is considering building unmanned
planes and may look to allied countries - such as Iran - for help.
Defense Minister General Raul Baduel said Monday in Caracas that Venezuela has
made progress in the development of pilotless planes.
He also said that Venezuela will look to other countries for help in
maintaining its aging U.S.-made F-5 fighter jets.
Venezuela has had trouble maintaining the planes since the United States began
blocking arms sales to the South American country.
