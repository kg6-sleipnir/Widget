Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert is scheduled to meet with Palestinian
President Mahmoud Abbas Wednesday in Jerusalem.

Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the talks will focus on permanent-
status issues, Israeli checkpoints and the fate of Palestinian prisoners.

The meeting, at Mr. Olmert's official residence, will be the first between the
two since Mr. Olmert announced that he will step down after his Kadima Party
chooses a new leader in September.

The two leaders re-started peace talks in November with the goal of reaching a
deal by this year's end.
