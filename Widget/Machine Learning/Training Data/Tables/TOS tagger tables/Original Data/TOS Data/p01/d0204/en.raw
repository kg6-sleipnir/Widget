The United States Government, Wednesday [May 14] officially added polar bears
to the list of threatened animals under the Endangered Species Act. Bush
administration scientists decided the species is at risk of becoming
endangered. Officials cited warming trends and loss of sea ice as threatening
the bears, opening a debate over whether to regulate greenhouse gases to
protect the bear and its habitat. Paul Sisco reports.
