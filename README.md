The goal of this project was to create a chatbot that uses natural language processing to process a sentence as input and generate a new sentence as a responce.

It has been awhile since I have even touched this project, and it might never even get completed. However, I am still glad I have accomplished this much as it was a great learning experience.

## Update 1/21/2024
With the new field of LLMs being a thing, I now know that if I ever did get to the point where I could train my own LLM, it would have taken months with hundreds of thousands of dollars in GPUs to train.
I may revive this project, but use Python so I don't have to deal with C++ and can just use existing LLMs.
